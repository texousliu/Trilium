<p>When Zen Mode is activated (pictured on the side), most of the user interface
  of Trilium is hidden away in order to be able to focus on the content,
  whether it's for reading or writing.</p>

<h2>Activating &amp; deactivating</h2>
<p>The Zen Mode can be activated by accessing the global menu and selecting
  the “Zen Mode” option:</p>
<p>Aside from the global menu, it's also possible to activate this mode by
  using a keyboard shortcut (which is <kbd>F9</kbd> since TriliumNext 0.92.5
  and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> for older versions). Look for <code spellcheck="false">toggleZenMode</code> in
  the shortcut configuration.</p>
<p>Once Zen Mode is activated, all the UI elements of the application will
  be hidden away, including the global menu. In that case, the Zen Mode can
  be deactivated either by pressing the
  <img src="Zen mode_image.png">icon in the top-right corner of the window or by pressing the keyboard
  combination again.</p>
<p>Do note that, by design, activating or deactivating the Zen Mode applies
  only to the current window. Restarting the application will also disable
  the Zen Mode.</p>
<h2>Moving the window around</h2>
<p>If “Native title bar” is activated, then the operating system's default
  title bar can be used to drag the window around. If deactivated, the window
  can still be moved by dragging the mouse across the top part of the window
  where the note titles are.</p>

<h2>Split windows and tabs</h2>
<p>Tabs are completely hidden, however it's still possible to use keyboard
  shortcuts such as <code spellcheck="false">firstTab</code> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd> by
  default), <code spellcheck="false">secondTab</code> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd> by
  default). There are also some newer shortcuts such as <code spellcheck="false">activateNextTab</code> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>)
  or <code spellcheck="false">activatePreviousTab</code> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>)
  that allow easy navigation, however make sure that they are configured
  properly in the settings.</p>
<p>For the split view of notes, there are no keyboard shortcuts at the time
  of writing, but it's still possible to have them in Zen Mode by creating
  the split while the Zen Mode is off and then reactivating it afterwards.</p>
