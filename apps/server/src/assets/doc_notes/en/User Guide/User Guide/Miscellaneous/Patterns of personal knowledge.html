<aside class="admonition note">
  <p>This article is a description of the original author of Trilium (zadam)
    in regards with his own knowledge base.</p>
</aside>
<p>This page contains description of some of the patterns I use to organize
  information in my knowledge base. This is meant to give some inspiration
  of how one might create and structure their knowledge base in general and
  also specifically in Trilium Notes. It also gives some background and justification
  for some of the design decisions.</p>
<h2>Meta patterns</h2>
<p>Just to be clear, meta patterns are "patterns of patterns", i.e. patterns
  appearing in other patterns.</p>
<h3>Hierarchical organization of information</h3>
<p>Basic meta pattern is that I sort notes (units of information) into a
  hierarchy - I have some "top level" notes which represent coarse grained
  organization, these then split into sub-notes defining finer grained organization
  and so on. I consider this hierarchical (tree) organization very efficient
  for organization of large amounts of information. A lot of note taking
  software (such as Evernote) are frustratingly limited in this regard which
  limits scalability of the software to large amounts of notes.</p>
<h4>Scalability</h4>
<p>It's important to frame the following (meta) patterns with some idea of
  how large amount of data are we talking about.</p>
<p>My rule of thumb for estimation of size of personal knowledge base is
  that you can reasonably produce around 10 notes a day, which is 3650 in
  a year. I plan to use my knowledge base long term (with or without Trilium
  Notes), probably decades so you can easily get to number 100 000 or even
  more. Right now, my personal knowledge base has around 10 000 notes.</p>
<p>100 000 is a number to which most note taking software doesn't scale well
  (in both performance and UI). Yet I don't think it's really very much considering
  a lifetime of knowledge.</p>
<h4>Lazy hierarchy</h4>
<p>My approach to creating the hierarchy is being lazy - I don't create the
  structure first and then fill it with notes, instead I create single note
  for some specific topic and start using this one note. Once the content
  starts to grow, and I see how <em>some</em> parts could be split out, I move
  them out into separate sub notes. As an example I have a book review for <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Book reviews
    <ul>
      <li>The Fellowship of the Ring</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The note contains basic book info (author, publisher etc.), book highlights
  with the comments and then overall review. Now it turns out there's far
  too many book highlights and overall review is also rather long, so I want
  to change the structure to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Book reviews
    <ul>
      <li>The Fellowship of the Ring &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>(still contains basic info)</em>
        <ul>
          <li>Highlights</li>
          <li>Review</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If I used standard text file stored in a filesystem I would soon run into
  an annoying problem that in order to split out the Highlights and Review
  into sub-notes I would also have to convert <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> from
  text file into directory and split out all sections of the note into sub-notes.
  Instead, Trilium treats all notes as equal - both leaf notes and inner
  notes can have both text content which allows me to sub-structure only
  content which needs it.</p>
<h3>Sorting notes into multiple places in the hierarchy</h3>
<p>While organizing the notes into the hierarchy, you very quickly run into
  a dilemma - your note seem to belong to two places in the hierarchy equally.
  As an example - you want to make a note about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">bash</a> -
  does it belong to "OS / Linux" or "Programming / Scripting languages"?
  This is actually a false dichotomy forced down by the limits of the basic
  tree hierarchy - the answer is <em>of course it belongs to both</em>. This
  is the reason why Trilium doesn't use standard tree structure (which requires
  every note to have exactly one parent), but an extension which allows every
  note to have several parents, thus effectively allowing it to appear in
  multiple places in the hierarchy. For lack of better term I call this "cloning".
  The main problem with this term is that it suggests that each clone must
  have an original, but here all clones are completely equal - effectively
  there's no original.</p>
<p>In tech lingo, it might be better to describe it as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link">hard link</a> with
  an important difference that it is possible to hard link (clone) a directory
  (inner note).</p>
<h3>Protected notes</h3>
<p>I have Trilium Notes opened non-stop. Sometimes I forget to lock my computer
  when going to the bathroom. Sometimes I let a friend or family member to
  use my computer for a minute without supervision. They might click on (running)
  Trilium and inadvertently see a note I really don't want anybody to see
  (personal diary, credentials). To cover this, Trilium has a concept of
  "<a href="https://github.com/zadam/trilium/wiki/Protected-notes">protected notes</a>"
  - protected note is encrypted and on top of that requires the user to enter
  the password every 5 minutes which guarantees that such note can be in
  a readable state only for small amount of time. Working with ordinary (not
  protected) notes don't require password so you're not bothered by extra
  security when it's not needed.</p>
<h3>Archiving notes</h3>
<p>Notes can lose relevancy with time - let's say I switch jobs - all the
  notes specific to the former employer immediately lose most of its import.
  This doesn't mean I want to delete these notes though - typically I just
  want them to somehow deprioritize - in Trilium I would do that by assigning
  an <a href="https://github.com/zadam/trilium/wiki/Attribute-inheritance">inherited</a> 
  <a
  href="https://github.com/zadam/trilium/wiki/Attributes">label</a> <code spellcheck="false">archived</code> to the company root note.
    The main effect of this label is that all the notes from this sub-tree
    are filtered out from search results (fast search via note autocomplete
    is my main <a href="https://github.com/zadam/trilium/wiki/Note-navigation">navigation approach</a>).
    Apart from this, I also typically move such outdated notes to some less
    prominent place in the hierarchy.</p>
<p>I use archivation also for notes which are not very relevant from their
  creation - an example might be automatically imported reddit comments.</p>
<p>Sometimes there's no clear <em>category</em> split between relevant and
  non-relevant notes, in that case I just create "<em>OLD</em>" note with
  <code
  spellcheck="false">archived</code>label and move all irrelevant notes there. So my credentials
    note might look something like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Credentials
    <ul>
      <li>Personal
        <ul>
          <li>OLD &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>(contains a bunch of notes with credentials for services I don't use anymore)</em>
          </li>
          <li>Gmail</li>
          <li>Github</li>
          <li>...</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Patterns</h2>
<h3>Day note</h3>
<p>Every day has its note which contains or references everything related
  to the given day. Structure looks like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2018
    <ul>
      <li>11 - November
        <ul>
          <li>26 - Monday</li>
          <li>27 - Tuesday
            <ul>
              <li>subnote 1</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Day note serves as a workspace and note inbox at the same time - it's
  the default location to create a note when I don't have time to think about
  proper placement. At the end of the day I typically review my day note
  and clone the notes into suitable locations in the hierarchy.</p>
<p>Trilium has this pattern partly built-in - Trilium understands and can
  create this Year / Month / Day structure semi-automatically (on API call).
  There's also global keyboard shortcut <code spellcheck="false">CTRL-ALT-P</code> which
  will create new note in the day note.</p>
<p>What notes do I keep under this day note?</p>
<ul>
  <li>TODO list for given day (this can be automated - see&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
    href="#root/_help_xYjQUYhpbUEW">Task Manager</a>)</li>
  <li>Personal diary</li>
  <li><a href="#root/_help_IakOLONlIfGI">clones</a> of notes I created during this
    day (which kind of represents what I've been working on).</li>
  <li>I often clone notes (or sub-trees) of e.g. projects I'm working on at
    given day so they are at hand</li>
  <li>I have some <a href="#root/_help_CdNpE2pqjmI6">scripts</a> which allow me to track
    certain daily metrics (like weight). These are saved into one daily "data
    note" (actually JSON <a href="#root/_help_6f9hih2hXXZk">code note</a>).
    <ul>
      <li>I have other scripts which then help me to visualize these data (see a&nbsp;
        <a
        class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_R7abl2fc6Mxi">Weight Tracker</a>&nbsp;example)</li>
      <li>I have a script which automatically imports all my comments from reddit
        into the day note.
        <ul>
          <li>People are sometimes wondering why. The answer is that I usually put some
            effort and thought into a comment and that's why I feel it's worth preserving,
            especially if it can be done automatically.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>For most notes, this day note placement is <em>secondary</em> and their
  primary location is somewhere else (e.g. for a book review I've been working
  on it's <em>Book / Reviews</em>, not the day note). So for this pattern
  to work, ability to <a href="#root/_help_IakOLONlIfGI">clone</a> notes into multiple
  places is pretty fundamental.</p>
<h3>Projects</h3>
<p><em>Project</em> is pretty self-explanatory, for me specifically it also
  means being long term (years) - an example of a project might be Trilium
  Notes or university studies. Given their longevity, projects can be large
  and deep, but their structure is very domain specific, and I don't see
  any common patterns. What's pretty clear is they are often widely interconnected
  with other parts of the knowledge base - e.g. university credentials are
  cloned from "Credentials / University" top level notes and Trilium related
  blog posts are in "Blog / [Name of the blog] / Trilium".</p>
<p><em>Epics</em> are the same thing as projects, but differ in scope - they
  are typically several months long and as such are usually placed into a
  year note (e.g. <em>2018 / Epics</em>). Epics are often of work nature (also
  cloned into work note) and personal (e.g. currently I have large epic for
  moving to a different city).</p>
<p>I don't have a term for short term projects (typically several days long),
  but continuing the scrum analogy I might call them <em>story</em>. These
  are often placed directly into day notes and manually moved from one day
  to another (or place into a month note, e.g. <em>2018 / 11 - November</em>).</p>
<h3>Credentials</h3>
<p>I keep all my credentials in the knowledge base, they are sorted into
  categories - work related, project related, personal per country etc. These
  notes are of course <a href="#root/_help_bwg0e8ewQMak">protected</a> and are often
  cloned into other places (e.g. project credentials are cloned into the
  project itself). This is a pretty important advantage compared to traditional
  tools like KeePass - all the relevant information is centralized into one
  place without compromising security.</p>
<h3>People profiles</h3>
<p>This might seem creepy to some, but I keep a profile on most people. It
  contains pretty standard things like date of birth, contacts, address,
  but also current and previous employments, their hobbies and worldviews
  and sometimes even important (IM/mail/meatspace) conversations. Just about
  everything I find notable. It helps to refresh some basic info before meeting
  people, especially if you haven't been in touch in a while. It gets pretty
  awkward to ask for the tenth time where do they work for example, because
  you keep forgetting it.</p>
<p>Naturally I have a lot of (extended) family members, friends, acquaintances
  etc. so I need some way to sort them. My main method is to sort them by
  social circle (work, high school, sports club etc.), sometimes also by
  their town of residence. Family <em>circle</em> is still too large so the
  further organization is by <em>clan</em> (as in "Smiths"). Some people are
  members of several such circles, so they are just cloned into multiple
  places.</p>
<p>For family specifically it's pretty useful to create <a href="#root/_help_iRwzGnHPzonm">relation map</a> to
  visualize relationships:</p>
<figure class="image">
  <img style="aspect-ratio:941/758;" src="Patterns of personal knowl.png"
  width="941" height="758">
</figure>
<p><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_lQcnSv5DMSe1">[missing note]</a>
</p>
<h3>Books</h3>
<p>Of course, I keep standard "To read" list. I also keep a record on the
  books I've read - typically one book has one subtree where the root has
  some basic info like author, page count, publication date, date started,
  date finished (in the form of&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_OFXdgB2nNk1F">Promoted Attributes</a>).
  I also write a (private) review and keep list of highlights from Kindle,
  optionally with some commentary, these are usually stored in sub notes
  (unless they are pretty short).</p>
<p>To keep the list of books manageable, I sort them per year (of reading
  them), this also gives me some basic overview of "reading performance"
  for given year. I plan to create a <a href="#root/_help_CdNpE2pqjmI6">script</a> which
  would show some timeline chart visualizing book attributes <code spellcheck="false">dateStarted</code> -
  <code
  spellcheck="false">dateFinished</code>to have nicer view of my reading sprints and trends.</p>
<p>Some specific authors also have their own note which contains cloned book
  reviews, links to interviews and other related resources.</p>
<p>I have similar system for movies and TV shows, but not as sophisticated.</p>
<h3>Personal diary</h3>
<p>This is a place to reflect on events, experiences, new findings etc. This
  can help you get deeper understanding of your inner self, clarify your
  thinking and make better decisions as a result.</p>
<p>I sort personal diary notes directly under <em>day note</em> (explained
  above), but it can be cloned also to e.g. "trip note" (if the diary note
  is about given trip) or to person's profile (if the person plays a role
  in the diary note). All my diary notes are <a href="#root/_help_bwg0e8ewQMak">protected</a> since
  they are usually pretty sensitive.</p>
<h3>Documents</h3>
<p>I keep all my personal documents (ID, passport, education certificates
  ...) scanned in the knowledge base. They are <a href="#root/_help_cbkrhQjrkKrh">synchronized</a> across
  every PC which provides decent backup and makes them available everywhere.</p>
<p>Advantage compared to e.g. keeping them in Dropbox or Google Drive is
  that they are not stored on some 3rd party server and they can be encrypted
  (<a href="#root/_help_bwg0e8ewQMak">protected</a>).</p>
<h3>Inventory</h3>
<p>Inventory contains documents and other relevant importation for my important
  belongings - e.g. for car you can keep the registration card, maintenance
  record, related costs etc. I also keep inventory for some items personally
  important to me - mainly computers, phones, cameras and similar electronics.
  This can be practical at times but also provides sentimental value.</p>
<h3>Topic knowledge base</h3>
<p>This where I store hard "knowledge" - summarized topics and findings from
  different domains. Topics can range from traditional sciences - physics,
  history, economy to philosophy, mental models, apps (notes about specific
  apps I use) etc. Of course this is very subjective - given what I do, my
  Physics sub-tree is pretty sparse compared to my Programming subtree.</p>
<h3>Work knowledge base</h3>
<p>I usually keep top level note for the company I currently work at (past
  jobs are moved elsewhere). I track basic organization of the company (divisions,
  business units), who is who (<a href="#root/_help_iRwzGnHPzonm">relation maps</a>)
  are again useful for visualization), projects I work at etc.</p>
<p>There's a number of credentials to various company services I need to
  use. Companies usually have a bunch of complex processes and tools. I record
  meeting minutes, link to the company wiki (which is usually difficult to
  find relevant info). In general there's a lot of company specific information
  I need to know or need have them at hand in a nice structure I can understand.
  Often it's just copy pasting and reshuffling of existing information into
  something more understandable for me.</p>
<p>From my experience, keeping this makes me more productive and even more
  importantly dramatically reduces frustration and stress.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I could probably go on with more patterns (e.g. study notes, travelling),
  but I think you get the idea. Whatever is important in your life, it probably
  makes sense to document and track it.</p>
