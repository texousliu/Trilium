<p>Sometimes, setting up a <a href="#root/_help_WOcw2SLH6tbX">dedicated server installation</a> is
  not feasible. The desktop application ships with a fully functional server
  instance by default.</p>
<p>You can access this web interface locally by navigating to <a href="http://localhost:37840/login">http://localhost:37840/login</a>.</p>
<aside
class="admonition note">
  <p>The server embedded in the desktop application will only run as long as
    the desktop application itself is running. So closing the application will
    also close the server. To overcome this, you can try hiding the application
    in the system tray.</p>

  <h2>Mobile interface</h2>
  <p>By default, this will display the desktop user interface, even on mobile.
    To switch to the mobile version, simply go to the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
    href="#root/_help_x3i7MxGccDuM">Global menu</a>&nbsp;and select “Switch to the
    mobile version”.</p>
  <h2>Allowing the port externally on Windows with Windows Defender Firewall</h2>
  <p>First, find out the IP of your desktop server by running <code spellcheck="false">ipconfig</code> in
    your local terminal. Then try accessing <code spellcheck="false">http://&lt;ip&gt;:37840/login</code> on
    another device. If it doesn't work, then most likely the port is blocked
    by your operating system's firewall.</p>
  <p>If you use Windows Defender Firewall:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to Windows's start menu and look for “Windows Defender Firewall with
      Advanced Security”.</li>
    <li>Go to “Inbound Rules” on the left tree, and select “New Rule” in the “Actions”
      sidebar on the right.</li>
    <li>Select “Port” and press “Next”.</li>
    <li>Type in <code spellcheck="false">37840</code> in the “Specific local ports”
      section and then press “Next”.</li>
    <li>Leave “Allow the connection” checked and press “Next”.</li>
    <li>Configure the networks to apply to (check all if unsure) and then press
      “Next”.</li>
    <li>Add an appropriate name to the rule (e.g. “Trilium Notes”) and press “Finish”.</li>
  </ol>
