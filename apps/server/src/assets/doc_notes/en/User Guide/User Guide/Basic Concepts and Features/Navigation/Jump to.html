<h2>Jump to Note</h2>
<p>The <em>Jump to Note</em> function allows easy navigation between notes
  by searching for their title. In addition to that, it can also trigger
  a full search or create notes.</p>
<p>To enter the “Jump to” dialog:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_xYmIYSP6wE3F">Launch Bar</a>,
    press
    <img src="2_Jump to_image.png">button.</li>
  <li>Using the keyboard, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to searching for notes, it is also possible to search for
  commands. See the dedicated section below for more information.</p>
<h3>Interaction</h3>
<ul>
  <li>By default, when there is no text entered it will display the most recent
    notes.</li>
  <li>Using the keyboard, use the up or down arrow keys to navigate between
    items. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open the desired note.</li>
  <li>If the note doesn't exist, it's possible to create it by typing the desired
    note title and selecting the <em>Create and link child note</em> option.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recent notes</h2>
<p>Jump to note also has the ability to show the list of recently viewed
  / edited notes and quickly jump to it.</p>
<p>To access this functionality, click on <code spellcheck="false">Jump to</code> button
  on the top. By default, (when nothing is entered into autocomplete), this
  dialog will show the list of recent notes.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can click on the "time" icon on the right.</p>
<h2>Command Palette</h2>

  <img style="aspect-ratio:982/524;" src="Jump to_image.png"

<p>The command palette is a feature which allows easy execution of various
  commands that can be found throughout the application, such as from menus
  or keyboard shortcuts. This feature integrates directly into the “Jump
  to” dialog.</p>
<h3>Interaction</h3>
<p>To trigger the command palette:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> to display the command
    palette directly.</li>
  <li>If in the “Jump to” dialog, type <code spellcheck="false">&gt;</code> in
    the search to switch to the command palette.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interaction:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Type a few words to filter between commands.</li>
  <li>Use the up and down arrows on the keyboard or the mouse to select a command.</li>
  <li>Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute the command.</li>
</ul>
<p>To exit the command palette:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the <code spellcheck="false">&gt;</code> in the search to go back
    to the note search.</li>
  <li>Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to dismiss the dialog entirely.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Options available</h3>
<p>Currently the following options are displayed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most of the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_A9Oc6YKKc65v">Keyboard Shortcuts</a>&nbsp;have
    an entry, with the exception of those that are too specific to be run from
    a dialog.</li>
  <li>Some additional options which are not yet available as keyboard shortcuts,
    but can be accessed from various menus such as: exporting a note, showing
    attachments, searching for notes or configuring the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
    href="#root/_help_xYmIYSP6wE3F">Launch Bar</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>Currently it's not possible to define custom actions that are displayed
  in the command palette. In the future this might change by integrating
  the options in the launch bar, which can be customized if needed.</p>
