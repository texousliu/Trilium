<h2>Inspiration for the name “Trilium”</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Naming software is hard. I lived in Ontario when I first started the project
    and Trillium (the flower) is sort of a provincial logo, many institutions
    in Ontario are named "Trillium [something]". So I kept hearing/reading
    it almost everyday, I liked the sound of it and its nature motif, so I
    just reused it.</p>
  <p><em>– Zadam (original Trilium maintainer)</em>
  </p>

<aside class="admonition note">
  <p>Despite the fact that the Trillium flower has two “l"s, the Trilium application
    only has one.</p>

<h2>macOS support</h2>
<p>Originally, Trilium Notes considered the macOS build unsupported. TriliumNext
  commits to make the experience on macOS as good as possible.</p>
<p>if you find any platform-specific issues, feel free to <a href="#root/_help_wy8So3yZZlH9">report them</a>.</p>
<h2>Translation / localisation support</h2>
<p>The original Trilium Notes application did not support multiple languages.
  Since we believe that internationalisation is a core part of an application,
  we have added support for it.</p>
<p>Contributions to translations are welcome.</p>
<h2>Multi-user support</h2>
<p>Common request is to allow multiple users collaborate, share notes etc.
  So far I'm resisting this because of these reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it's a huge feature, or rather a Pandora's box of collaboration features
    like user management, permissions, conflict resolution, real-time editing
    of a note by multiple people etc. This would be a huge amount of work.
    Trilium Notes is project made mostly by one person in free time and that's
    unlikely to change in the future.</li>
  <li>given its size it would probably pivot the attention away from my main
    focus which is a personal note-taking</li>
  <li>the assumption that only single person has access to the app simplifies
    many things, or just outright makes them possible. In multi-user app, our
    <a
    href="#root/_help_CdNpE2pqjmI6">scripting</a>support would be a XSS security hole, while with the single
      user assumption it's an endless customizable tool.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to open multiple documents in one Trilium instance</h2>
<p>This is normally not supported - one Trilium process can open only a single
  instance of a <a href="#root/_help_wX4HbRucYSDD">database</a>. However, you can
  run two Trilium processes (from one installation), each connected to a
  separate document. To achieve this, you need to set a location for the
  <a
  href="#root/_help_tAassRL4RSQL">data directory</a>in the <code spellcheck="false">TRILIUM_DATA_DIR</code> environment
    variable and separate port on <code spellcheck="false">TRILIUM_PORT</code> environment
    variable. How to do that depends on the platform, in Unix-based systems
    you can achieve that by running command such as this:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">TRILIUM_DATA_DIR=/home/me/path/to/data/dir TRILIUM_PORT=12345 trilium </code></pre>
<p>You can save this command into a <code spellcheck="false">.sh</code> script
  file or make an alias. Do this similarly for a second instance with different
  data directory and port.</p>
<h2>Can I use Dropbox / Google Drive / OneDrive to sync data across multiple computers.</h2>
<p>No.</p>
<p>These general purpose sync apps are not suitable to sync database files
  which are open and being worked on by another application. The result is
  that they will corrupt the database file, resulting in data loss and this
  message in the Trilium logs:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">SqliteError: database disk image is malformed</code></pre>
<p>The only supported way to sync Trilium's data across the network is to
  use a <a href="#root/_help_cbkrhQjrkKrh">sync/web server</a>.</p>
<h2>Why database instead of flat files?</h2>
<p>Trilium stores notes in a <a href="#root/_help_wX4HbRucYSDD">database</a> which
  is an SQLite database. People often ask why doesn't Trilium rather use
  flat files for note storage - it's fair question since flat files are easily
  interoperable, work with SCM/git etc.</p>
<p>Short answer is that file systems are simply not powerful enough for what
  we want to achieve with Trilium. Using filesystem would mean fewer features
  with probably more problems.</p>
<p>More detailed answer:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#root/_help_IakOLONlIfGI">clones</a> are what you might call "hard directory
    link" in filesystem lingo, but this concept is not implemented in any filesystem</li>
  <li>filesystems make a distinction between directory and file while there's
    intentionally no such difference in Trilium</li>
  <li>files are stored in no particular order and user can't change this</li>
  <li>Trilium allows storing note <a href="#root/_help_zEY4DaJG4YT5">attributes</a> which
    could be represented in extended user attributes but their support differs
    greatly among different filesystems / operating systems</li>
  <li>Trilium makes links / relations between different notes which can be quickly
    retrieved / navigated (e.g. for <a href="#root/_help_BCkXAVs63Ttv">note map</a>).
    There's no such support in file systems which means these would have to
    be stored in some kind of side-car files (mini-databases).</li>
  <li>Filesystems are generally not transactional. While this is not completely
    required for a note-taking application, having transactions make it way
    easier to keep notes and their metadata in predictable and consistent state.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Search-related Questions</h2>
<h3>Why does search sometimes find results with typos?</h3>
<p>Trilium uses a progressive search strategy that includes fuzzy matching
  when exact matches return fewer than 5 results. This finds notes despite
  minor typos in your search query. You can use fuzzy search operators (
  <code
  spellcheck="false">~=</code>for fuzzy exact match and <code spellcheck="false">~*</code> for
    fuzzy contains). See the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_eIg8jdvaoNNd">Search</a>&nbsp;documentation
    for details.</p>
<h3>How can I search for notes when I'm not sure of the exact spelling?</h3>
<p>Use the fuzzy search operators:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code spellcheck="false">#title ~= "projct"</code> - finds notes with titles
    like "project" despite the typo</li>
  <li><code spellcheck="false">note.content ~* "algoritm"</code> - finds content
    containing "algorithm" or similar words</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why do some search results appear before others with lower scores?</h3>
<p>Trilium places exact matches before fuzzy matches. When you search for
  "project", notes containing exactly "project" appear before notes with
  variations like "projects" or "projection", regardless of other scoring
  factors.</p>
<h3>How can I make my searches faster?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Use the "Fast search" option to search only titles and attributes (not
    content)</li>
  <li>Limit search scope using the "Ancestor" field</li>
  <li>Set a result limit to prevent loading too many results</li>
  <li>For large databases, consider archiving old notes to reduce search scope</li>
</ol>
