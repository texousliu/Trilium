<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>A webview needs to know which URL to render, and it can be provided by
  setting the <code spellcheck="false">webViewSrc</code>  <a href="#root/_help_zEY4DaJG4YT5">label</a>,
  such as:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">#webViewSrc="https://www.wikipedia.org"</code></pre>
<h2>Web view on the server vs. Electron</h2>
<p>When accessing Trilium via a browser instead of the desktop application,
  the web view will still try to render the content of the desired webpage.
  However, since it's running in a browser there are quite a few limitations
  as opposed to the desktop one.</p>
<p>More specifically, quite a few websites oppose being embedded in another
  website (technically they have a non-permisive <code spellcheck="false">X-Frame-Options</code> header).
  This is not bypassable by Trilium so the page will simply fail to render.</p>
<p>You can diagnose this by right clicking the Trilium web page → Inspect
  (element) and looking in the “Console” tab for errors such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code spellcheck="false">Refused to display 'https://www.google.com/' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'sameorigin'.</code>
  </li>
  <li><code spellcheck="false">Refused to frame 'https://duckduckgo.com/' because an ancestor violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "frame-ancestors 'self' https://html.duckduckgo.com".</code>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few websites that do render such as <code spellcheck="false">wikipedia.org</code>.</p>
<p>Do note that we are also applying some sandboxing constraints on the server
  side, so if you have any issues other than the unresolvable <code spellcheck="false">X-Frame-Options</code> described
  above, feel free to report them.</p>
<p>On the desktop side, a different technology is used which bypasses the
  constraints of an <code spellcheck="false">iframe</code> (<code spellcheck="false">webview</code>).</p>
