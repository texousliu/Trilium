<p>A Trilium instance represents a server. If&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/_help_cbkrhQjrkKrh">Synchronization</a>&nbsp;is set up, since multiple
  servers are involved (the one from the desktop client and the one the synchronisation
  is set up with), sometimes it can be useful to distinguish the instance
  you are running on.</p>
<h2>Setting the instance name</h2>
<p>To set up a name for the instance, modify the <code spellcheck="false">config.ini</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">[General]
instanceName=Hello</code></pre>
<h2>Distinguishing the instance on back-end</h2>
<p>Use <code spellcheck="false">api.getInstanceName()</code> to obtain the
  instance name of the current server, as specified in the config file or
  in environment variables.</p>
<h2>Limiting script runs based on instance</h2>
<p>For a script that is run periodically or on a certain event, it's possible
  to limit it to certain instances without having to change the code. Just
  add <code spellcheck="false">runOnInstance</code> and set as the value the
  instance name where the script should run. To run on multiple named instances,
  simply add the label multiple times.</p>
