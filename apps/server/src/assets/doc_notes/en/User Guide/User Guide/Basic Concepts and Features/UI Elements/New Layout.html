<p>The <em>New layout</em> is a series of UI/UX changes that were introduced
  in v0.101.0 that heavily change both existing UI elements, as well as adding
  some new ones. The goal of this new layout is to modernize the application
  and to make it more intuitive but at the same time to reduce clutter.</p>
<h2>Newly introduced features</h2>
<h3>Status bar</h3>
<p>At the bottom of the window there is a new bar called the <em>Status bar</em>.
  This bar houses multiple items such as the Breadcrumb navigation and information
  and settings about the current note, such as the <a href="#root/_help_veGu4faJErEM">content language</a> and&nbsp;
  <a
  class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_zEY4DaJG4YT5">Attributes</a>.</p>
<p>For more information, consult the <a href="#root/_help_AlJ73vBCjWDw">dedicated page</a>.</p>

  </figure>
  <h3>Inline title</h3>
  <p>In previous versions of Trilium, the title bar was fixed at all times.
    In the new layout, there is both a fixed title bar and one that scrolls
    with the text. The newly introduced title is called the <em>Inline title</em> and
    it displays the title in a larger font, while also displaying additional
    information such as the creation and the modification date.</p>
  <p>Whenever the title is scrolled past, the fixed title is shown instead.</p>
  <p>This only affects&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_iPIMuisry3hd">Text</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
    <a
    class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_6f9hih2hXXZk">Code</a>&nbsp;notes. Note types that take the entirety of the screen such
      as&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_grjYqerjn243">Canvas</a>&nbsp;will
      always have only the fixed title bar.</p>
  <p>Depending on the note type, the inline title will also present some more
    interactive options such as being able to switch the note type (see below).</p>

    <h3>New note type switcher</h3>
    <p>When a new&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_iPIMuisry3hd">Text</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;
      <a
      class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_6f9hih2hXXZk">Code</a>&nbsp;note is created, a note type switcher will appear below
        the <em>Inline title</em>. Apart from changing the note type, it's also
        possible to apply a <a href="#root/_help_KC1HB96bqqHX">template</a>.</p>
    <p>The switcher will disappear as soon as a text is entered.</p>

    <h3>Note badges</h3>
    <p>Note badges appear near the fixed note title and indicate important information
      about the note such as whether it is read-only. Some of the badges are
      also interactive.</p>

      <img style="aspect-ratio:910/49;" src="3_New Layout_image.png"

    <p>The following badges are available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li data-list-item-id="e27c647a2fb2066455e2838bb97b70f96"><strong>Read-only badge</strong>, which will be shown if the note is not
        editable due to either automatic read-only or manual read-only. Clicking
        on the badge will temporarily edit the note (similar to the Edit <a href="#root/_help_XpOYSgsLkTJy">floating button</a>).</li>
      <li
      data-list-item-id="ef60c0c30855b13cd03a90d8a8152290f"><strong>Share badge</strong>, which will indicate that the current note
        is shared. The badge will also indicate if the share is on the local network
        (for the desktop application without&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_cbkrhQjrkKrh">Synchronization</a>&nbsp;set
        up) or publicly accessible (for the server).</li>
        <li data-list-item-id="e612e0099e7c44dd0b0a2dfe41f00e7b4"><strong>Web clip badge</strong>, which will indicate if the note was clipped
          using the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_MtPxeAWVAzMg">Web Clipper</a>.
          The badge acts as a link, so it can be clicked on to navigate to the page
          or right clicked for more options.</li>
        <li data-list-item-id="e8c8d943f232b9dcf2060b06b0e778d0a"><strong>Execute badge</strong>, for <a href="#root/_help_CdNpE2pqjmI6">scripts</a> or
          <a
          href="#root/_help_YKWqdJhzi2VY">saved SQL queries</a>which have an execute button or a description.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some of these badges replace the dedicated panels at the top of the note.</p>

    <h2>Changing to the existing layout</h2>
    <h3>Removal of the ribbon</h3>
    <p>The most significant change is the removal of the ribbon. All the actions
      and options from the ribbon were integrated in other places in the application.</p>
    <p>Here's how all the different tabs that were once part of the ribbon are
      now available in the new layout:</p>
    <ul>

    <h3>Removal of the floating buttons</h3>
    <p>Most of the buttons were relocated to the right of the note title, in
      the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_8YBEPzcpUgxw">Note buttons</a>&nbsp;area,
      with the exception of:</p>

    </ul>
    <h3>Changes to the sidebar</h3>
    <p>The sidebar (also known as the right pane) also received some important
      changes.</p>
    <p>The previous iteration of the sidebar would appear contextually, depending
      on whether there are any items to be displayed. This caused occasional
      content shifts when moving between two panes in a split view. In the new
      layout, the sidebar acts more like the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_oPVyFC7WL2Lp">Note Tree</a>&nbsp;pane,
      remaining visible even if there is nothing to display.</p>
    <p>In order to toggle the sidebar, there is a new button on the top-right
      side of the screen, near the window buttons (on Windows and Linux).</p>
    <p>Now each section of the sidebar (e.g. “Table of Contents”, “Highlights
      list”) is individually collapsible and will remember whether it was collapsed.</p>
    <p>Some sidebar items also have a contextual menu, indicated by the three
      dots on the title. For example, the highlights filter can be adjusted directly
      from that menu.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Custom widgets are still supported. For custom scripts, the three dots
      menu allows quick navigation to the corresponding script note.</p>
    <h2>How to toggle the new layout</h2>
    <p>Starting with v0.101.0, this new layout is enabled by default. It is possible
      to fall back to the old layout by going to&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
      href="#root/_help_4TIF1oA4VQRO">Options</a>&nbsp;→ Appearance and selecting <em>Old layout</em>.</p>
    <aside
    class="admonition important">
      <p>Since a new layout was introduced, this becomes the standard one. The <em>Old layout</em> is
        considered deprecated and will not receive new features (for example, the
        breadcrumb) as we focus on the new one. At some point the old layout will
        be removed entirely, as maintaining two layouts with major differences
        creates a maintenance burden.</p>
