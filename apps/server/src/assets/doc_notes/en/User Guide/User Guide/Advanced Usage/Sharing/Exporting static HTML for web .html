<p>As described in&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_R9pX4DGra2Vt">Sharing</a>,
  Trilium can act as a public server in which the shared notes are displayed
  in read-only mode. While this can work in most cases, it's generally not
  meant for high-traffic websites and since it's running on a Node.js server
  it can be potentially exploited.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to generate static HTML files (just like other
  static site generators such as <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/">MkDocs</a>).
  Since the normal HTML ZIP export does not contain any styling or additional
  functionality, Trilium provides a way to export the same layout and style
  as the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_R9pX4DGra2Vt">Sharing</a>&nbsp;function
  into static HTML files.</p>
<p>Apart from the enhanced security, these HTML files are also easy to deploy
  on “serverless” deployments such as GitHub Pages or CloudFlare Pages and
  cache very easily.</p>
<aside class="admonition tip">
  <p>Trilium's documentation, available at <a href="https://docs.triliumnotes.org/">docs.triliumnotes.org</a> is
    built using this function of exporting to static HTML files which are then
    deployed automatically to CloudFlare Pages.</p>
  <p>The process is <a href="https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/blob/main/apps/edit-docs/src/build-docs.ts">automated</a> by
    importing the Markdown documentation and exporting it via a script to the
    static web format.</p>

<h2>Differences from normal sharing</h2>
<p>Apart from normal&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_R9pX4DGra2Vt">Sharing</a>,
  exporting to static HTML files comes with a few subtle differences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The URL structure is different. Where in normal sharing it's something
    along the way of <code spellcheck="false">example.com/share/noteid</code>,
    the notes follow an hierarchical structure, such as <code spellcheck="false">docs.triliumnotes.org/user-guide/concepts/navigation/tree-concepts</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code spellcheck="false">favicon.ico</code> is not handled automatically,
    it needs to be manually added on the server after the export is generated.</li>
  <li>The “Last updated” for notes is not available.</li>
  <li>The search functionality works slightly different since the normal one
    requires an active API to work. In the static export, search still works
    but uses a different mechanism so results might be different.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Differences from normal .zip export</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The name of the files/URLs will prefer <code spellcheck="false">shareAlias</code> to
    allow for clean URLs.</li>
  <li>The export requires a functional web server as the pages will not render
    properly if accessed locally via a web browser due to the use of module
    scripts.</li>
  <li>The directory structure is also slightly different:
    <ul>
      <li>A normal HTML export results in an index file and a single directory.</li>
      <li>Instead, for static exporting the top-root level becomes the index file
        and the child directories are on the root instead.</li>
      <li>This makes it possible to easily publish to a website, without forcing
        everything but the root note to be in a sub-directory.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Testing locally</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, the exported static pages require a website to
  function. In order to test locally, a web server needs to be used.</p>
<p>One example is to use the Node.js-based <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server"><code spellcheck="false">http-server</code></a> which
  can be installed via:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">npm i -g http-server</code></pre>
<p>Once installed simply:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Extract the exported .zip file.</li>
  <li>Inside the extracted directory, run <code spellcheck="false">http-server</code>.</li>
  <li>Access the indicated address (e.g. <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Automation</h2>
<p><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_pgxEVkzLl1OP">ETAPI (REST API)</a>&nbsp;could
  potentially be used to automate an export on a scheduled task.</p>
