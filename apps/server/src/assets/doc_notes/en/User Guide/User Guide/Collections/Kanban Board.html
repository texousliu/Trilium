<p>The Board view presents sub-notes in columns for a Kanban-like experience.
  Each column represents a possible value for a status label, which can be
  adjusted.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>When first creating a collection of <em>Board</em> type, a few subnotes
  will be created, each having a <code>#status</code> label set. The board
  then groups each note by the value of the status attribute.</p>
<p>Notes are displayed recursively, so even the child notes of the child
  notes will be displayed. However, unlike the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/_help_2FvYrpmOXm29">Table</a>, the notes are not displayed in a hierarchy.</p>
<h2>Interaction</h2>
<h3>Working with columns</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create a new column by pressing <em>Add Column</em> near the last column.
    <ul>
      <li>Once pressed, a text box will be displayed to set the name of the column.
        Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm, or <kbd>Escape</kbd> to dismiss.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To reorder a column, simply hold the mouse over the title and drag it
    to the desired position.</li>
  <li>To delete a column, right click on its title and select <em>Delete column</em>.</li>
  <li>To rename a column, click on the note title.
    <ul>
      <li>Press Enter to confirm.</li>
      <li>Upon renaming a column, the corresponding status attribute of all its
        notes will be changed in bulk.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If there are many columns, use the mouse wheel to scroll.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Working with notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create a new note in any column by pressing <em>New item</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter the name of the note and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or click away. To
        dismiss the creation of a new note, simply press <kbd>Escape</kbd> or leave
        the name empty.</li>
      <li>Once created, the new note will have an attribute (<code>status</code> label
        by default) set to the name of the column.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To open the note, simply click on it.</li>
  <li>To change the title of the note directly from the board, hover the mouse
    over its card and press the edit button on the right.</li>
  <li>To change the state of a note, simply drag a note from one column to the
    other to change its state.</li>
  <li>The order of the notes in each column corresponds to their position in
    the tree.
    <ul>
      <li>It's possible to reorder notes simply by dragging them to the desired
        position within the same columns.</li>
      <li>It's also possible to drag notes across columns, at the desired position.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For more options, right click on a note to display a context menu with
    the following options:
    <ul>
      <li>Open the note in a new tab/split/window or quick edit.</li>
      <li>Move the note to any column.</li>
      <li>Insert a new note above/below the current one.</li>
      <li>Archive/unarchive the current note.</li>
      <li>Delete the current note.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If there are many notes within the column, move the mouse over the column
    and use the mouse wheel to scroll.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Keyboard interaction</h2>
<p>The board view has mild support for keyboard-based navigation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to navigate between
    column titles, notes and the “New item” button for each of the columns,
    in sequential order.</li>
  <li>To rename a column or a note, press <kbd>F2</kbd> while it is focused.</li>
  <li>To open a specific note or create a new item, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> while
    it is focused.</li>
  <li>To dismiss a rename of a note or a column, press <kbd>Escape</kbd>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<h3>Grouping by another attribute</h3>
<p>By default, the label used to group the notes is <code>#status</code>.
  It is possible to use a different label if needed by defining a label named <code>#board:groupBy</code> with
  the value being the attribute to use (without <code>#</code> attribute prefix).</p>
<aside
class="admonition note">
  <p>It's currently not possible to set a relation as the grouping criteria.
    There are plans to add support for it.</p>
  </aside>
  <h2>Limitations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>It is not possible yet to use group by a relation, only by label.</li>
  </ul>
