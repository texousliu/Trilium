<p>Nightly releases are versions built every day, containing the latest improvements
  and bugfixes, directly from the main development branch. These versions
  are generally useful in preparation for a release, to ensure that there
  are no significant bugs that need to be addressed first, or they can be
  used to confirm whether a particular bug is fixed or feature is well implemented.</p>
<h2>Regarding the stability</h2>
<p>Despite being on a development branch, generally the main branch is pretty
  stable since PRs are tested before they are merged. If you notice any issues,
  feel free to report them either via a ticket or via the Matrix.</p>
<h2>Downloading the nightly release manually</h2>
<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/releases/tag/nightly">github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/releases/tag/nightly</a> and
  look for the artifacts starting with <code spellcheck="false">TriliumNotes-main</code>.
  Choose the appropriate one for your platform (e.g. <code spellcheck="false">windows-x64.zip</code>).</p>
<p>Depending on your use case, you can either test the portable version or
  even use the installer.</p>
<aside class="admonition note">
  <p>If you choose the installable version (e.g. the .exe on Windows), it will
    replace your stable installation.</p>

  <p>By default, the nightly uses the same database as the production version.
    Generally you could easily downgrade if needed. However, if there are changes
    to the database or sync version, it will not be possible to downgrade without
    having to restore from a backup.</p>

<h2>Automatically download and install the latest nightly</h2>
<p>This is pretty useful if you are a beta tester that wants to periodically
  update their version:</p>
<p>On Ubuntu:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">#!/usr/bin/env bash

name=TriliumNotes-linux-x64-nightly.deb
rm -f $name*
wget https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/releases/download/nightly/$name
sudo apt-get install ./$name
rm $name</code></pre>
