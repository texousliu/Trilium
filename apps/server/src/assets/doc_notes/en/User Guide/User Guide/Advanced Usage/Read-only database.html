  <p>This functionality is still in preview, expect possible issues or even
    the feature disappearing completely.

<p>The read-only database is an alternative to&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/_help_R9pX4DGra2Vt">Sharing</a>&nbsp;notes. Although the share functionality
  works pretty well to publish pages to the Internet in a wiki, blog-like
  format it does not offer the full functionality behind Trilium (such as
  the advanced&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_eIg8jdvaoNNd">Search</a>&nbsp;or
  the interactivity behind&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_GTwFsgaA0lCt">Collections</a>&nbsp;or
  the various&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_KSZ04uQ2D1St">Note Types</a>).</p>
<p>When the database is in read-only mode, the Trilium application can be
  used as normal, but editing is disabled and changes are made in-memory
  only.</p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All notes are read-only, without the possibility of editing them.</li>
  <li>Features that would normally alter the database such as the list of recent
    notes are disabled.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Some features might “slip through” and still end up creating a note, for
    example.
    <ul>
      <li>However, the database is still read-only, so all modifications will be
        reset if the server is restarted.</li>
      <li>Whenever this occurs, <code spellcheck="false">ERROR: read-only DB ignored</code> will
        be shown in the logs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting a database as read-only</h2>
<p>First, make sure the database is initialized (e.g. the first set up is
  complete). Then modify the <a href="#root/_help_Gzjqa934BdH4">config.ini</a> by
  looking for the <code spellcheck="false">[General]</code> section and adding
  a new <code spellcheck="false">readOnly</code> field:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">[General]
readOnly=true</code></pre>
<p>If your server is already running, restart it to apply the changes.</p>
<p>Similarly, to disable read-only remove the line or set it to <code spellcheck="false">false</code>.</p>
