<p>In Trilium, attributes are key-value pairs assigned to notes, providing
  additional metadata or functionality. There are two primary types of attributes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_HI6GBBIduIgv">Labels</a>&nbsp;can
      be used for a variety of purposes, such as storing metadata or configuring
      the behavior of notes. Labels are also searchable, enhancing note retrieval.</p>
    <p>For more information, including predefined labels, see&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
      href="#root/_help_HI6GBBIduIgv">Labels</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_Cq5X6iKQop6R">Relations</a>&nbsp;define
      connections between notes, similar to links. These can be used for metadata
      and scripting purposes.</p>
    <p>For more information, including a list of predefined relations, see&nbsp;
      <a
      class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_Cq5X6iKQop6R">Relations</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>These attributes play a crucial role in organizing, categorizing, and
  enhancing the functionality of notes.</p>
<h2>Types of attributes</h2>
<p>Conceptually there are two types of attributes (applying to both labels
  and relations):</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>System attributes</strong>
    <br>As the name suggest, these attributes have a special meaning since they
    are interpreted by Trilium. For example the <code spellcheck="false">color</code> attribute
    will change the color of the note as displayed in the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
    href="#root/_help_oPVyFC7WL2Lp">Note Tree</a>&nbsp;and links, and <code spellcheck="false">iconClass</code> will
    change the icon of a note.</li>
  <li><strong>User-defined attributes</strong>
    <br>These are free-form labels or relations that can be used by the user.
    They can be used purely for categorization purposes (especially if combined
    with&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_eIg8jdvaoNNd">Search</a>),
    or they can be given meaning through the use of&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
    href="#root/_help_CdNpE2pqjmI6">Scripting</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice, Trilium makes no direct distinction of whether an attribute
  is a system one or a user-defined one. A label or relation is considered
  a system attribute if it matches one of the built-in names (e.g. like the
  aforementioned <code spellcheck="false">iconClass</code>). Keep this in
  mind when creating &nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_OFXdgB2nNk1F">Promoted Attributes</a>&nbsp;in
  order not to accidentally alter a system attribute (unless intended).</p>
<h2>Viewing the list of attributes</h2>
<p>Both the labels and relations for the current note are displayed in the <em>Owned Attributes</em> section
  of the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_BlN9DFI679QC">Ribbon</a>,
  where they can be viewed and edited. Inherited attributes are displayed
  in the <em>Inherited Attributes</em> section of the ribbon, where they can
  only be viewed.</p>
<p>In the list of attributes, labels are prefixed with the <code spellcheck="false">#</code> character
  whereas relations are prefixed with the <code spellcheck="false">~</code> character.</p>
<h2>Attribute Definitions and Promoted Attributes</h2>
<p><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_OFXdgB2nNk1F">Promoted Attributes</a>&nbsp;create
  a form-like editing experience for attributes, which makes it easy to enhancing
  the organization and management of attributes</p>
<h2>Multiplicity</h2>
<p>Attributes in Trilium can be "multi-valued", meaning multiple attributes
  with the same name can co-exist. This can be combined with&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/_help_OFXdgB2nNk1F">Promoted Attributes</a>&nbsp;to easily add them.</p>
<h2>Attribute Inheritance</h2>
<p>Trilium supports attribute inheritance, allowing child notes to inherit
  attributes from their parents. For more information, see&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/_help_bwZpz2ajCEwO">Attribute Inheritance</a>.</p>
