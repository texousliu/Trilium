<p>Slash commands is a feature of&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_iPIMuisry3hd">Text</a>&nbsp;notes
  which allows easily accessing commonly used commands simply by using the
  keyboard, without having to remember dedicated&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/_help_A9Oc6YKKc65v">Keyboard Shortcuts</a>.</p>
<h2>Interaction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>As the name suggests, to trigger the slash commands simply press the <kbd>/</kbd> key
    to trigger it. Note that this can be anywhere in a paragraph as long as
    it's not part of the word, if it doesn't show up simply press a space and
    press the <kbd>/</kbd> key again.</li>
  <li>Use <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> keys to navigate between options.</li>
  <li>By default, the full list of commands is displayed.</li>
  <li>To search by title or description, simply start typing for an action.</li>
  <li>To trigger an action, press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Integration with other features</h2>
<p>Apart from the common set of commands, some features are specially integrated
  with the slash commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For <a href="#root/_help_NwBbFdNZ9h7O">admonitions</a>, each admonition
    type (e.g. note, tip) will be individually displayed.</li>
  <li>Every&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_pwc194wlRzcH">Text Snippets</a>&nbsp;will
    also appear individually, making it easy to insert them.</li>
</ul>
