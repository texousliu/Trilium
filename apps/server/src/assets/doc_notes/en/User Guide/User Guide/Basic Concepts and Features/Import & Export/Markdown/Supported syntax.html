<p><a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub-Flavored Markdown</a> is
  the main syntax that Trilium is following.</p>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>When exporting, images are usually kept in the basic Markdown syntax but
  will use the HTML syntax if the image has a custom width. Figures are always
  embedded as HTML.</p>
<h2>Tables</h2>
<p>Simple tables are supported with the Markdown syntax. If the table is
  too complex or contains elements that would render as HTML, the table is
  also rendered as HTML.</p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Standard Markdown links are supported.</p>
<p>Trilium internal links (that mirror a note's title and display its icon)
  are embedded as HTML in order to preserve the information on import.</p>
<h2>Math equations</h2>
<p>Both inline and display equations are supported, using the <code spellcheck="false">$</code> and
  <code
  spellcheck="false">$$</code>syntaxes.</p>
<h2>Admonitions</h2>
<p>The Markdown syntax for admonitions as supported by Trilium is the one
  that GitHub uses, which is as follows:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This is a note.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; This is a tip.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; This is a very important information.

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; This is a caution.</code></pre>
<p>There are currently no plans of supporting alternative admonition syntaxes
  such as <code spellcheck="false">!!! note</code>.</p>
<h2>Wikilinks</h2>
<p>Basic support for wikilinks has been added in v0.96.0:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code spellcheck="false">[[foo/bar]]</code> will look for the <code spellcheck="false">bar.md</code> file
    in the <code spellcheck="false">foo</code> directory and turn it into an
    internal link.</li>
  <li><code spellcheck="false">![[foo/baz.png]]</code> will look for the
    <code
    spellcheck="false">baz.png</code>file in the <code spellcheck="false">foo</code> directory
      and turn it into an image.</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature is import-only, which means that it will turn wikilinks into
  Trilium-compatible syntax, but it will not export Trilium Notes into Markdown
  files with this syntax.</p>
<aside class="admonition important">
  <p>The path to pages in wikilinks is resolved relatively to the <em>import root</em> and
    not the current directory of the note. This is to be inline with other
    platforms that use wikilinks such as SilverBullet.</p>
  <p>The root path of the import is determined as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If there is a single directory within the archive at root level, then
      that directory is considered the root.</li>
    <li>If there are multiple files &amp; directories at root level, then the
      archive root (containing all of these items) is considered the root.</li>
  </ul>
