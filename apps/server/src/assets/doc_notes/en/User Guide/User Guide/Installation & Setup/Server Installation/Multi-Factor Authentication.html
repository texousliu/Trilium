<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security process that requires
  users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a system,
  application, or account. This adds an extra layer of protection beyond
  just using a password.</p>
<p>By requiring more than one verification method, MFA helps reduce the risk
  of unauthorized access, even if someone has obtained your password. It’s
  highly recommended for securing sensitive information stored in your notes.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: OpenID and TOTP cannot be both used at the same
  time!</p>
<h2>Log in with your Google Account with OpenID!</h2>
<p>OpenID is a standardized way to let you log into websites using an account
  from another service, like Google, to verify your identity.</p>
<h2>Why Time-based One Time Passwords?</h2>
<p>TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) is a security feature that generates
  a unique, temporary code on your device, like a smartphone, which changes
  every 30 seconds. You use this code, along with your password, to log into
  your account, making it much harder for anyone else to access them.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>MFA can only setup on server instance.</p>
<h3>TOTP</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Go to "Menu" -&gt; "Options" -&gt; "MFA"</li>
  <li>Click the “Enable Multi-Factor Authentication” checkbox if not checked</li>
  <li>Choose “Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP)” under MFA Method</li>
  <li>Click the "Generate TOTP Secret" button</li>
  <li>Copy the generated secret to your authentication app/extension</li>
  <li>Click the "Generate Recovery Codes" button</li>
  <li>Save the recovery codes. Recovery codes can be used once in place of the
    TOTP if you loose access to your authenticator. After a rerecovery code
    is used, it will show the unix timestamp when it was used in the MFA options
    tab.</li>
  <li>Re-login will be required after TOTP setup is finished (After you refreshing
    the page).</li>
</ol>
<h3>OpenID</h3>
<p><em>Currently only compatible with Google. Other services like Authentik and Auth0 are planned on being added.</em>
</p>
<p>In order to setup OpenID, you will need to setup a authentication provider.
  This requires a bit of extra setup. Follow <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect">these instructions</a> to
  setup an OpenID service through google.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Set the <code>oauthBaseUrl</code>, <code>oauthClientId</code> and <code>oauthClientSecret</code> in
    the <code>config.ini</code> file, which located under the Trilium data folder.
    <ol>
      <li>You can also setup through environment variables (<code>TRILIUM_OAUTH_BASE_URL</code>, <code>TRILIUM_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>TRILIUM_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET</code>),
        but the recommanded way is setup through <code>config.ini</code> file.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Restart the server</li>
  <li>Go to "Menu" -&gt; "Options" -&gt; "MFA"</li>
  <li>Click the “Enable Multi-Factor Authentication” checkbox if not checked</li>
  <li>Choose “OAuth/OpenID” under MFA Method</li>
  <li>Refresh the page and login through OpenID provider</li>
</ol>
