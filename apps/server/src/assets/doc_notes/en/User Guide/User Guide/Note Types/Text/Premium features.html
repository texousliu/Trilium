<p>The text editor we are using for&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_iPIMuisry3hd">Text</a>&nbsp;notes
  is called CKEditor and it's a commercial product. The core components are
  open-source, however they <a href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/trial/latest/index.html">offer quite a few features</a> that
  require a commercial license in order to be used.</p>
<p>We have reached out to the CKEditor team in order to obtain a license
  in order to have some of these extra features and they have agreed, based
  on a signed agreement.</p>
<h2>How the license works</h2>
<p>The license key is stored in the application and it enables the use of
  the previously described premium features. The license key has an expiration
  date which means that the features can become disabled if using an older
  version of the application for extended periods of time.</p>
<h2>Can I opt out of these features?</h2>
<p>At this moment there is no way to disable these features, apart from manually
  modifying the source code. If this is a problem, <a href="#root/_help_wy8So3yZZlH9">let us know</a>.</p>
<p>If you have the possibility of rebuilding the source code (e.g. if a package
  maintainer), then modify <code spellcheck="false">VITE_CKEDITOR_KEY</code> in
  <code
  spellcheck="false">apps/client/.env</code>to be <code spellcheck="false">GPL</code>.</p>
