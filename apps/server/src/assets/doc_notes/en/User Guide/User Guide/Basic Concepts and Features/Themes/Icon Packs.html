<h2>Importing an existing icon pack</h2>
<p>Icon packs are specific to Trilium, so they must either be created from
  scratch (see below) or imported from a ZIP file from a third-party developer.</p>
<aside
class="admonition note">
  <p><strong>Icon packs are third-party content</strong>
  </p>
  <p>The Trilium maintainers are not responsible for keeping these icon packs
    up to date. If you have an issue with a specific icon pack, then the issue
    must be reported to the third-party developer responsible for it, not the
    Trilium team.</p>
  </aside>
  <p>To import an icon pack:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Ideally, create a dedicated spot in your note tree where to place the
      icon packs.</li>
    <li>Right click the note where to put it and select <em>Import into note</em>.</li>
    <li>Uncheck <em>Safe import</em>.</li>
    <li>Select <em>Import</em>.</li>
    <li><a href="#root/_help_s8alTXmpFR61">Refresh the application</a>.</li>
  </ol>
  <aside class="admonition warning">
    <p>Since <em>Safe import</em> is disabled, make sure you trust the source as
      it could contain dangerous third-party scripts. One good way to check if
      the icon pack is safe is to manually extract the .zip and inspect the file
      contents. Icon packs should only contain a font file and a JSON file. Other
      files (especially scripts) are to be considered harmful.</p>
  </aside>
  <h2>Creating an icon pack</h2>
  <p>Creating an icon pack requires some scripting knowledge outside Trilium
    in order to generate the list of icons. For information, see&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
    href="#root/_help_g1mlRoU8CsqC">Creating an icon pack</a>.</p>
  <h2>Using an icon from an icon pack</h2>
  <p>After <a href="#root/_help_s8alTXmpFR61">refreshing the application</a>, the
    icon pack should be enabled by default. To test this, simply select an
    existing note or create a new one and try to change the note icon.</p>
  <p>There should be a <em>Filter</em> button to the right of the search bar
    in the icon list. Clicking it allows filtering by icon pack and the newly
    imported icon pack should be displayed there.</p>
  <aside class="admonition note">
    <p>If the icon pack is missing from that list, then most likely there's something
      wrong with it.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Try checking the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_bnyigUA2UK7s">Backend (server) logs</a>&nbsp;for
        clues and make sure that the icon pack has the <code spellcheck="false">#iconPack</code> 
        <a
        href="#root/_help_HI6GBBIduIgv">label</a>with a value assigned to it (a prefix).</li>
      <li>Icon packs that are <a href="#root/_help_bwg0e8ewQMak">protected</a> are ignored.</li>
    </ul>
  </aside>
  <h2>Integration with the share and export functionality</h2>
  <p>Custom icon packs are also supported by the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
    href="#root/_help_R9pX4DGra2Vt">Sharing</a>&nbsp;feature, where they will be
    shown in the note tree. However, in order for an icon pack to be visible
    to the share function, the icon pack note must also be shared.</p>
  <p>If you are using a custom share theme, make sure it supports the
    <code
    spellcheck="false">iconPackCss</code>, otherwise icons will not show up. Check the original
      share template source code for reference.</p>
  <p>Custom icon packs will also be preserved when&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
    href="#root/_help_ycBFjKrrwE9p">Exporting static HTML for web publishing</a>.
    In this case, there's no requirement to make the icon pack shared.</p>
  <h2>What happens if I remove an icon pack</h2>
  <p>If an icon pack is removed or disabled (by removing or altering its
    <code
    spellcheck="false">#iconPack</code>label), all the notes that use this icon pack will show
      in the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_oPVyFC7WL2Lp">Note Tree</a>&nbsp;with
      no icon. This won't cause any issues apart from looking strange.</p>
  <p>The solution is to replace the icons with some else, try using&nbsp;
    <a
    class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_eIg8jdvaoNNd">Search</a>&nbsp;which supports bulk actions, to identify the notes with
      the now deleted icon pack (by looking for the prefix) and changing or removing
      their <code spellcheck="false">iconClass</code>.</p>
