<h2>Why is my widget clipped by other UI elements</h2>
<p>For performance and layout reasons, the size of widgets in Trilium is
  independent from its children. At CSS level, this means that the widget
  container has <code spellcheck="false">contain: size</code> applied to it.</p>
<p>This works well if the widget has a fixed size (or based on its parent
  container), however to make a widget resize to fit its content, apply the
  following change:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-diff">class MyWidget extends api.RightPanelWidget {

+   constructor() {
+       super();
+       this.contentSized();
+   }
        
}</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively apply <code spellcheck="false">contain: none</code> to its
  CSS.</p>
