<p>In Trilium, is possible to work with two or more notes side-by-side.</p>

<h2><strong>Interactions</strong></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Press the
      <img src="Split View_Split View_imag.png">button to the right of a note's title to open a new split to the right
      of it.
      <ul>
        <li>It is possible to have as many splits as desired, simply press again the
          button.</li>
        <li>Only horizontal splits are possible, vertical or drag &amp; dropping is
          not supported.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>When at least one split is open, press the
      <img src="Split View_3_Split View_im.png">button next to it to close it.</li>
    <li>Use the
      <img src="Split View_4_Split View_im.png">or the
      <img src="Split View_1_Split View_im.png">button to move around the splits.</li>
    <li>Each <a href="#root/_help_3seOhtN8uLIY">tab</a> has its own split view configuration
      (e.g. one tab can have two notes in a split view, whereas the others are
      one-note views).
      <ul>
        <li>The tab will indicate only the title of the main note (the first one in
          the list).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Splits and the note tree &amp; hoisting</h2>
  <p>Clicking on the content of a split will focus that split. While focused,
    the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_oPVyFC7WL2Lp">Note Tree</a>&nbsp;will
    also indicate the note that is being edited.</p>
  <p>It is possible for each of the splits to have their own&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
    href="#root/_help_OR8WJ7Iz9K4U">Note Hoisting</a>.</p>
  <p>When a new split is created, it will share the same note hoisting as the
    previous one. An easy solution to this is to simply hoist the notes after
    the split is created.</p>
  <p>This is generally quite useful for reorganizing notes from one place to
    the other, by hoisting the old place in the first split and hoisting the
    new place to the second one. This will allow easy cut and paste without
    the tree jumping around from switching between notes.</p>
  <h2>Mobile support</h2>
  <p>Since v0.100.0, it's possible to have a split view on the mobile view
    as well, with the following differences from the desktop version of the
    split:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On smartphones, the split views are laid out vertically (one on the top
      and one on the bottom), instead of horizontally as on the desktop.</li>
    <li>There can be only one split open per tab.</li>
    <li>It's not possible to resize the two split panes.</li>
    <li>When the keyboard is opened, the active note will be “maximized”, thus
      allowing for more space even when a split is open. When the keyboard is
      closed, the splits become equal in size again.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Interaction:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To create a new split, click the three dots button on the right of the
      note title and select <em>Create new split</em>.
      <ul>
        <li>This option will only be available if there is no split already open in
          the current tab.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To close a split, click the three dots button on the right of the note
      title and select <em>Close this pane</em>.
      <ul>
        <li>Note that this option will only be available on the second note in the
          split (the one at the bottom on smartphones, the one on the right on tablets).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>When long-pressing a link, a contextual menu will show up with an option
      to <em>Open note in a new split</em>.
      <ul>
        <li>If there's already a split, the option will replace the existing split
          instead.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
