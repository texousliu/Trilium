      <img src="Split View_Split View_imag.png">button to the right of a note's title to open a new split to the right
      of it.
      <ul>
        <li data-list-item-id="eda17492ea2d8da7c4bf2fb3e2f7bfbe9">It is possible to have as many splits as desired, simply press again the

    <li data-list-item-id="ec9d11f5bcfd10795f282e275938b2f4a">Use the
      <img src="Split View_4_Split View_im.png">or the

    <li data-list-item-id="e8384a579c3d6ee8df4d7dbf9b07c3436">Each <a href="#root/_help_3seOhtN8uLIY">tab</a> has its own split view configuration
      (e.g. one tab can have two notes in a split view, whereas the others are
      one-note views).
      <ul>
        <li data-list-item-id="e298299f6b2f1b9d8b5f26a5f8a0c9092">The tab will indicate only the title of the main note (the first one in
          the list).</li>

  <h2>Splits and the note tree &amp; hoisting</h2>
  <p>Clicking on the content of a split will focus that split. While focused,
    the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_oPVyFC7WL2Lp">Note Tree</a>&nbsp;will
    also indicate the note that is being edited.</p>
  <p>It is possible for each of the splits to have their own&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
    href="#root/_help_OR8WJ7Iz9K4U">Note Hoisting</a>.</p>
  <p>When a new split is created, it will share the same note hoisting as the
    previous one. An easy solution to this is to simply hoist the notes after
    the split is created.</p>
  <p>This is generally quite useful for reorganizing notes from one place to
    the other, by hoisting the old place in the first split and hoisting the
    new place to the second one. This will allow easy cut and paste without
    the tree jumping around from switching between notes.</p>
  <h2>Mobile support</h2>
  <p>Since v0.100.0, it's possible to have a split view on the mobile view
    as well, with the following differences from the desktop version of the
    split:</p>
  <ul>
    <li data-list-item-id="efc0bb8eb81ea1617b73188613f2ede5d">On smartphones, the split views are laid out vertically (one on the top
      and one on the bottom), instead of horizontally as on the desktop.</li>
    <li
    data-list-item-id="e7659da22c36db39ae8e3dc5424afba1e">There can be only one split open per tab.</li>
  </ul>
