<p>Promoted attributes are <a href="#root/_help_zEY4DaJG4YT5">attributes</a> which
  are displayed prominently in the UI which allow them to be easily viewed
  and edited.</p>
<p>One way of seeing promoted attributes is as a kind of form with several
  fields. Each field is just regular attribute, the only difference is that
  they appear on the note itself.</p>
<p>Attributes can be pretty useful since they allow for querying and script
  automation etc. but they are also inconveniently hidden. This allows you
  to select few of the important ones and push them to the front of the user.</p>
<h2>Attribute definition</h2>
<p>In order to have promoted attributes, there needs to be a way to define
  them.</p>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right image_resized" style="width:38.82%;">
  <img style="aspect-ratio:492/346;" src="1_Promoted Attributes_image.png"
  width="492" height="346">
</figure>
<p>Technically, attributes are only name-value pairs where both name and
  value are strings.</p>
<p>The <em>Attribute definition</em> specifies how should this value be interpreted:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is it just string, or is it a date?</li>
  <li>Should we allow multiple values or note?</li>
  <li>Should we <em>promote</em> the attribute or not?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating a new promoted attribute definition</h2>
<p>To create a new promoted attribute:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to a note.</li>
  <li>Go to <em>Owned Attributes</em> in the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_BlN9DFI679QC">Ribbon</a>.</li>
  <li>Press the + button.</li>
  <li>Select either <em>Add new label definition</em> or <em>Add new relation definition</em>.</li>
  <li>Select the name which will be name of the label or relation that will
    be created when the promoted attribute is edited.</li>
  <li>Ensure <em>Promoted</em> is checked in order to display it at the top of
    notes.</li>
  <li>Optionally, choose an <em>Alias</em> which will be displayed next to the
    promoted attribute instead of the attribute name. Generally it's best to
    choose a “user-friendly” name since it can contain spaces and other characters
    which are not supported as attribute names.</li>
  <li>Check <em>Inheritable</em> to apply it to this note and all its descendants.
    To keep it only for the current note, un-check it.</li>
  <li>Press “Save &amp; Close” to apply the changes.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How attribute definitions actually work</h2>
<p>When a new promoted attribute definition is created, it creates a corresponding
  label prefixed with either <code spellcheck="false">label</code> or
  <code
  spellcheck="false">relation</code>, depending on the definition type:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">#label:myColor(inheritable)="promoted,alias=Color,multi,color"</code></pre>
<p>The only purpose of the attribute definition is to set up a template.
  If the attribute was marked as promoted, then it's also displayed to the
  user for easy editing.</p>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <figure class="image">
          <img style="aspect-ratio:495/157;" src="2_Promoted Attributes_image.png"
          width="495" height="157">
        </figure>
      </td>
      <td>Notice how the promoted attribute definition only creates a “Due date”
        box above the text content.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <figure class="image">
          <img style="aspect-ratio:663/160;" src="3_Promoted Attributes_image.png"
          width="663" height="160">
        </figure>
      </td>
      <td>Once a value is set by the user, a new label (or relation, depending on
        the type) is created. The name of the attribute matches one set when creating
        the promoted attribute.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>So there's one attribute for value and one for definition. But notice
  how an definition attribute can be made <a href="#root/_help_bwZpz2ajCEwO">Inheritable</a>,
  meaning that it's also applied to all descendant notes. In this case, the
  definition used for the whole sub-tree while "value" attributes are for
  each not individually.</p>
<h2>Using system attributes</h2>
<p>It's possible to create promoted attributes out of system attributes,
  to be able to easily alter them.</p>
<p>Here are a few practical examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_GTwFsgaA0lCt">Collections</a>&nbsp;already
    make use of this practice, for example:
    <ul>
      <li>Calendars add “Start Date”, “End Date”, “Start Time” and “End Time” as
        promoted attributes. These map to system attributes such as <code spellcheck="false">startDate</code> which
        are then interpreted by the calendar view.</li>
      <li><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_zP3PMqaG71Ct">Presentation</a>&nbsp;adds
        a “Background” promoted attribute for each of the slide to easily be able
        to customize.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Trilium documentation (which is edited in Trilium) uses a promoted
    attribute to be able to easily edit the <code spellcheck="false">#shareAlias</code> (see&nbsp;
    <a
    class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_R9pX4DGra2Vt">Sharing</a>) in order to form clean URLs.</li>
  <li>If you always edit a particular system attribute such as <code spellcheck="false">#color</code>,
    simply create a promoted attribute for it to make it easier.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inverse relation</h3>
<p>Some relations always occur in pairs - my favorite example is on the family.
  If you have a note representing husband and note representing wife, then
  there might be a relation between those two of <code spellcheck="false">isPartnerOf</code>.
  This is bidirectional relationship - meaning that if a relation is pointing
  from husband to wife then there should be always another relation pointing
  from wife to husband.</p>
<p>Another example is with parent-child relationship. Again these always
  occur in pairs, but in this case it's not exact same relation - the one
  going from parent to child might be called <code spellcheck="false">isParentOf</code> and
  the other one going from child to parent might be called <code spellcheck="false">isChildOf</code>.</p>
<p>Relation definition allows you to specify such "inverse relation" - for
  the relation you just define you specify which is the inverse relation.
  Note that in the second example we should have two relation definitions
  - one for <code spellcheck="false">isParentOf</code> which defines <code spellcheck="false">isChildOf</code> as
  inverse relation and then second relation definition for <code spellcheck="false">isChildOf</code> which
  defines <code spellcheck="false">isParentOf</code> as inverse relation.</p>
<p>What this does internally is that whenever we save a relation which has
  defined inverse relation, we check that this inverse relation exists on
  the relation target note. Similarly, when we delete relation, we also delete
  inverse relation on the target note.</p>
