<p>The breadcrumb allows quickly viewing the note hierarchy of the current
  note and navigating through it.</p>
<p>It is part of the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_AlJ73vBCjWDw">Status bar</a>,
  displayed in the bottom-left of the screen.</p>
<h2>Layout and Interaction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If a note or workspace is hoisted, a badge will appear on the left-most
    side.
    <ul>
      <li>Clicking on the badge will un-hoist the note/workspace.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The left-most icon represents the root note, or the hoisted note or workspace.
    <ul>
      <li>Clicking the icon will jump to the root note.</li>
      <li>Right clicking the icon will display a menu that allows opening the note
        in a new tab, split, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Each segment shows the title of a note in the current note hierarchy.
    <ul>
      <li>Clicking the icon will jump to that note.</li>
      <li>Right clicking will open a menu with multiple options such as opening
        the note in a different tab/split/window, hoisting, moving/cloning the
        note, duplicating as well as changing the color of the note.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clicking the arrow next to each segment will reveal the child notes of
    the segment on the left.
    <ul>
      <li>Clicking on an icon will navigate to that particular note.</li>
      <li>It's also possible to create a new child note from here.</li>
      <li>The menu can optionally hide the archived notes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If the current note is deep within a hierarchy, the segments will collapse
    into a […] button in order not to occupy too much space.
    <ul>
      <li>Clicking this button will display each collapsed entry as a menu item.
        Clicking on it will navigate to that particular note.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Right clicking on an empty space to the right of the breadcrumb (before
    the other status bar items) will reveal another menu that allows:
    <ul>
      <li>Toggling whether archived notes are displayed in the breadcrumb and in
        the note tree.</li>
      <li>Copying the current note path to clipboard.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
