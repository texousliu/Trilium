<p>Trilium Web Clipper is a web browser extension which allows user to clip
  text, screenshots, whole pages and short notes and save them directly to
  Trilium Notes.</p>
<p>Project is hosted <a href="https://github.com/TriliumNext/web-clipper">here</a>.</p>
<p>Firefox and Chrome are supported browsers, but the chrome build should
  work on other chromium based browsers as well.</p>
<h2>Functionality</h2>
<ul>
  <li>select text and clip it with the right-click context menu</li>
  <li>click on an image or link and save it through context menu</li>
  <li>save whole page from the popup or context menu</li>
  <li>save screenshot (with crop tool) from either popup or context menu</li>
  <li>create short text note from popup</li>
</ul>
<p>Trilium will save these clippings as a new child note under a "clipper
  inbox" note.</p>
<p>By default, that's the <a href="#root/_help_l0tKav7yLHGF">day note</a> but you
  can override that by setting the <a href="#root/_help_zEY4DaJG4YT5">label</a> 
  <code
  spellcheck="false">clipperInbox</code>, on any other note.</p>
<p>If there's multiple clippings from the same page (and on the same day),
  then they will be added to the same note.</p>
<p><strong>Extension is available from:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/TriliumNext/web-clipper/releases">Project release page</a> -
    .xpi for Firefox and .zip for Chromium based browsers.</li>
  <li><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/trilium-web-clipper/dfhgmnfclbebfobmblelddiejjcijbjm">Chrome Web Store</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>The extension needs to connect to a running Trilium instance. By default,
  it scans a port range on the local computer to find a desktop Trilium instance.</p>
<p>It's also possible to configure the <a href="#root/_help_WOcw2SLH6tbX">server</a> address
  if you don't run the desktop application, or want it to work without the
  desktop application running.</p>
<h2>Username</h2>
<p>Older versions of Trilium (before 0.50) required username &amp; password
  to authenticate, but this is no longer the case. You may enter anything
  in that field, it will not have any effect.</p>
