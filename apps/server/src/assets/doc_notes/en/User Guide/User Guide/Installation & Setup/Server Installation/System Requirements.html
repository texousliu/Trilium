<h2>Legacy ARM support</h2>
<p>The Docker builds also provide <code spellcheck="false">linux/arm/v7</code> and
  <code
  spellcheck="false">linux/arm/v8</code>platforms. These platforms are considered legacy since
    Trilium uses Node.js version 24 which have <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/6682861d6f">officially downgraded support</a> for
    these platforms to “experimental”.</p>
<p>As a result, Trilium needs to use Node.js 22 for these versions. As soon
  as soon Node.js 22 will no longer be compatible, support for <code spellcheck="false">armv7</code> and
  <code
  spellcheck="false">armv8</code>will be dropped entirely.</p>
<p>Regardless of upstream support, these platforms are supported on a best-effort
  basis and are not officially supported by the Trilium development team.
  Bug reports are accepted but they will not be treated with priority; contributions
  are welcome.</p>
