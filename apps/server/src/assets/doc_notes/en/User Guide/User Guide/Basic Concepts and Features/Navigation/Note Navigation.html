<p>One of the Trilium's goals is to provide fast and comfortable navigation
  between notes.</p>
<h2>Backwards and forward</h2>
<p>You can use alt-left and alt-right to move back and forward in history
  of viewed pages.</p>
<p>This works identically to browser backwards / forwards, it's actually
  using built-in browser support for this.</p>

<h2>Jump to note</h2>
<p>This is useful to quickly find and view arbitrary notes - click on
  <code
  spellcheck="false">Jump to</code>button on the top or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> .
    Then type part of the note name and autocomplete will help you pick the
    desired note.</p>
