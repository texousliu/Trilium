<p>Internal links are links to other notes within Trilium.</p>
<p>You can open an internal link by clicking it. You can also see a read-only
  preview of an internal link's contents by hovering over it.</p>
<h2>Inserting internal links</h2>
<p>Internal links can be created at the current position in a text note by:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> or the
    <img src="Internal (reference) links.png"
    width="20" height="17">button underneath the
    <img src="1_Internal (reference) links.png"
    width="34" height="16">menu in the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_nRhnJkTT8cPs">Formatting toolbar</a>.</li>
  <li>Searching for the title of the desired note to link. It's also possible
    to create new notes from this dialog by typing a non-existing note title
    and selecting <em>Create and link child note</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two link types which you can select when creating the link to
  the note:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Link title mirrors the note's current title</em>
    <ol>
      <li>This is sometimes also called "reference link".</li>
      <li>The title of this link cannot be changed. Instead, it will always show
        the current title of the linked note.</li>
      <li>The icon of the linked note will also be displayed.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><em>Link title can be changed arbitrarily</em>
    <ol>
      <li>This will create a traditional hyperlink, where the text of the link can
        be different from the note title.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>In-place linking</h2>
<p>You can also insert internal links “inline” by using the <code spellcheck="false">@</code> symbol:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Type <code spellcheck="false">@</code> in a text note, which will open the
    note search menu.</li>
  <li>Search for the desired note's title by typing a few characters. Use <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> to
    select the correct note, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Tab</kbd> to create
    the link. It's also possible to create new notes with this method by typing
    a non-existing note title and selecting <em>Create and link child note</em>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Pasting internal links</h2>
<p>You can also insert internal links by copying a note from the note tree.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_oPVyFC7WL2Lp">Note Tree</a>,
    select a note and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.</li>
  <li>In a text note, paste the link by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
