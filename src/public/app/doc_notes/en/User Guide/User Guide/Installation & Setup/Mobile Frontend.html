      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Trilium (<a href="Server%20Installation.html">server edition</a>) has
          a mobile web frontend which is optimized for touch based devices - smartphones
          and tablets. It is activated automatically during login process based on
          browser detection.</p>
        <p>Mobile frontend is limited in features compared to full desktop frontend.
          See below for more details on this.</p>
        <p>Note that this is not an Android/iOS app, this is just mobile friendly
          web page served on the <a href="Server%20Installation.html">server edition</a>.</p>

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>Mobile frontend provides only some of the features of the full desktop
          frontend:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>it is possible to browse the whole note tree, read and edit all types
            of notes, but you can create only text notes</li>
          <li>reading and editing <a href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Notes/Protected%20Notes.html">protected notes</a> is
            possible, but creating them is not supported</li>
          <li>editing options is not supported</li>
          <li>cloning notes is not supported</li>
          <li>uploading file attachments is not supported</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Forcing mobile/desktop frontend</h2>
        <p>Trilium decides automatically whether to use mobile or desktop frontend.
          If this is not appropriate, you can use <code>?mobile</code> or <code>?desktop</code> query
          param on <strong>login</strong> page (Note: you might need to log out).</p>
        <h2>Scripting</h2>
        <p>You can alter the behavior with <a href="../Scripting.html">scripts</a> just
          like for normal frontend. For script notes to be executed, they need to
          have labeled <code>#run=mobileStartup</code>.</p>
