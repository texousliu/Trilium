        <p>Note is a central entity in Trilium. Main attributes of note are title
          and content.</p>
        <h3>Note types</h3>
        <p>The main note type is a rich-text note type called&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
          href="#root/_help_iPIMuisry3hd">Text</a>. For diagrams and drawing there
          is&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_grjYqerjn243">Canvas</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
          <a
          class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_s1aBHPd79XYj">Mermaid Diagrams</a>.</p>
        <p>There are also more complex note types such as&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
          href="#root/_help_m523cpzocqaD">Saved Search</a>,&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
          href="#root/_help_HcABDtFCkbFN">Render Note</a>&nbsp;that usually go hand-in-hand
          with&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_CdNpE2pqjmI6">Scripting</a>.</p>
        <p>In Trilium there's no specific "folder" note type. Any note can have children
          and thus be a folder.</p>
        <h3>Root note</h3>
        <p>There's one special note called "root note" which is root of the note
          tree. All other notes are placed below it in the structure.</p>
        <h3>Tree structure</h3>
        <p>Importantly, note itself doesn't carry information on its placement in
          note tree. See&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_IakOLONlIfGI">Cloning Notes</a>&nbsp;for
          details.</p>
        <p>Tree structure of notes can resemble file system - but compared to that
          notes in Trilium can act as both file and directory - meaning that note
          can both have its own content and have children. "Leaf note" is a note
          which doesn't have any children.</p>
        <h3>Deleting / undeleting notes</h3>
        <p>When you delete a note in Trilium, it is actually only marked for deletion
          (soft-delete) - the actual content, title, attributes etc. are not deleted,
          only hidden.</p>
        <p>Within (by default) 7 days, it is possible to undelete these soft-deleted
          notes - open the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_r5JGHN99bVKn">Recent Changes</a>&nbsp;dialog,
          and you will see a list of all modified notes including the deleted ones.
          Notes available for undeletion have a link to do so. This is kind of "trash
          can" functionality known from e.g. Windows.</p>
        <p>Clicking an undelete will recover the note, it's content and attributes
          - note should be just as before being deleted. This action will also undelete
          note's children which have been deleted in the same action.</p>
        <p>To be able to undelete a note, it is necessary that deleted note's parent
          must be undeleted (otherwise there's no place where we can undelete it
          to). This might become a problem when you delete more notes in succession
          - the solution is then undelete in the reverse order of your deletion.</p>
        <p>After the 7 days (configurable) the notes will be "erased" - their title,
          content, revisions and attributes will be erased, and it will not be possible
          anymore to recover them (unless you restore a&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
          href="#root/_help_ODY7qQn5m2FT">Backup</a>).</p>
