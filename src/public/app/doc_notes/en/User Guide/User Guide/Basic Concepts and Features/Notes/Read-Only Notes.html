        <p>Some note types such as&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="../../Note%20Types/Text.html">Text</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
          <a
          class="reference-link" href="../../Note%20Types/Code.html">Code</a>&nbsp;notes in Trilium can be set to read-only. When a note is
            in read-only mode, it is presented to the user in a non-editable view,
            with the option to switch to editing mode if needed.</p>
        <h2>Automatic read-only mode</h2>
        <p>For optimization purposes, Trilium will automatically set very large notes
          to read-only. Displaying such lengthy notes in editing mode can slow down
          performance, especially when editing is unnecessary.</p>
        <p>This behavior can be disabled on a per-note basis, by following the instructions
          of the next section.</p>
        <p>In addition, it's possible to change the number of characters at which
          the automatic read-only mode will trigger in&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
          href="../UI%20Elements/Options.html">Options</a>&nbsp;by going to the options
          for&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_hidden/_options/_optionsTextNotes">Text Notes</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
          <a
          class="reference-link" href="#root/_hidden/_options/_optionsCodeNotes">Code Notes</a>.</p>
        <h2>Changing a note's read-only behavior</h2>
        <p>Via the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="../UI%20Elements/Ribbon.html">Ribbon</a>,
          by going to the <em>Basic Properties</em> tab and looking for the <em>Editable</em> selection.
          The following options are possible:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Auto</strong>
            <br>This is the default behavior in which the note will be editable by default,
            unless it becomes large enough to trigger read-only mode.
            <br>&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Read-only</strong>
            <br>The note will be always marked as read-only, regardless of its size. Nevertheless,
            it's still possible to temporarily edit the note if needed. This is generally
            useful for notes that are not prone to change.
            <br>&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Always Editable</strong>
            <br>This option will bypass the automatic read-only activation for this particular
            note. It's useful for large notes that are frequently edited.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the <em>Editable</em> section is missing from the ribbon, then the note
          type does not support read-only mode.</p>
        <h3>Manually setting the options</h3>
        <p>Apart from using the ribbon as previously mentioned, it's also possible
          to use <a href="../../Advanced%20Usage/Attributes.html">labels</a> to change
          the behavior:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To set as read-only, apply the <code>readOnly</code> label to the note.</li>
          <li>To disable automatic read-only (always editable), apply the <code>autoReadOnlyDisabled</code> label.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Temporarily editing a read-only note</h2>
        <p>When accessing a read-only note, it's possible to temporarily edit it
          by using the
          <img src="Read-Only Notes_image.png">button in the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="../UI%20Elements/Floating%20buttons.html">Floating buttons</a>&nbsp;area.</p>
        <p>When pressed, the note will become editable but will become read-only
          again after navigating to a different note.</p>
        <h2>Special read-only behavior</h2>
        <p>Some note types have a special behavior based on whether the read-only
          mode is enabled:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a class="reference-link" href="../../Note%20Types/Mermaid%20Diagrams.html">Mermaid Diagrams</a>&nbsp;will
            hide the Mermaid source code and display the diagram preview in full-size.
            In this case, the read-only mode can be easily toggled on or off via a
            dedicated button in the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="../UI%20Elements/Floating%20buttons.html">Floating buttons</a>&nbsp;area.</li>
        </ul>
