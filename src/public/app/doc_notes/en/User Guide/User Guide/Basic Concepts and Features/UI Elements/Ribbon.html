        <p>The ribbon allows changing options, attributes and viewing information
          about the current note.</p>
        <h2>Settings</h2>
        <p>It is possible to change whether some ribbon items will be automatically
          open when navigating to a new note. To do so, in&nbsp;<a href="Options.html">Settings</a>,
          go to <em>Appearance</em> and look for the <em>Ribbon widgets</em> section.</p>
        <h2>Formatting</h2>
        <p>If you are using the <em>Fixed</em> formatting toolbar, all the formatting
          buttons for text notes will appear here. See&nbsp;<a href="../../Note%20Types/Text/Formatting%20toolbar.html">Formatting toolbar</a>&nbsp;for
          more information.</p>

              <li>As a more advanced use, it's possible to change the note type in order
                to modify the <a href="../../Advanced%20Usage/Note%20source.html">source code</a> of
                a note.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em><strong>Protect the note</strong></em> toggles whether the current
            note is encrypted and accessible only by entering the protected session.

            more information.</li>

              <li>Enters <a href="../Notes/Read-Only%20Notes.html">read-only mode</a> automatically
                if the note is too big (default behaviour).</li>
              <li>Is always in read-only mode (however it can still be edited temporarily).</li>
              <li>Is always editable, regardless of its size.</li>
