        </p>
        <p>Screenshot of the note contextual menu indicating the “Export as PDF”
          option.</p>
        <p>On the desktop application of Trilium it is possible to export a note
          as PDF. On the server or PWA (mobile), the option is not available due
          to technical constraints and it will be hidden.</p>
        <p>To print a note, select the
          <img src="1_Export as PDF_image.png">button to the right of the note and select <em>Export as PDF</em>.</p>
        <p>Afterwards you will be prompted to select where to save the PDF file.</p>
        <h2>Automatic opening of the file</h2>
        <p>When the PDF is exported, it is automatically opened with the system default
          application for easy preview.</p>
        <p>Note that if you are using Linux with the GNOME desktop environment, sometimes
          the default application might seem incorrect (such as opening in GIMP).
          This is because it uses Gnome's “Recommended applications” list.</p>
        <p>To solve this, you can change the recommended application for PDFs via
          this command line. First, list the available applications via <code>gio mime application/pdf</code> and
          then set the desired one. For example to use GNOME's Evince:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">gio mime application/pdf</code></pre>
        <h2>Reporting issues with the rendering</h2>
        <p>Should you encounter any visual issues in the resulting PDF file (e.g.
          a table does not fit properly, there is cut off text, etc.) feel free to
          <a
          href="#root/OeKBfN6JbMIq/jRV1MPt4mNSP/hrC6xn7hnDq5">report the issue</a>. In this case, it's best to offer a sample note (click
            on the
            <img src="1_Export as PDF_image.png">button, select Export note → This note and all of its descendants → HTML
            in ZIP archive). Make sure not to accidentally leak any personal information.</p>
        <h2>Landscape mode</h2>
        <p>When exporting to PDF, there are no customizable settings such as page
          orientation, size, etc. However, it is possible to specify a given note
          to be printed as a PDF in landscape mode by adding the <code>#printLandscape</code> attribute
          to it (see&nbsp;<a href="#root/9QRytp0ZYFIf/PnO38wN0ffOA">[missing note]</a>).</p>
        <h2>Page size</h2>
        <p>By default, the resulting PDF will be in Letter format. It is possible
          to adjust it to another page size via the <code>#printPageSize</code> attribute,
          with one of the following values: <code>A0</code>, <code>A1</code>, <code>A2</code>, <code>A3</code>, <code>A4</code>, <code>A5</code>, <code>A6</code>, <code>Legal</code>, <code>Letter</code>, <code>Tabloid</code>, <code>Ledger</code>.</p>
        <h2>Keyboard shortcut</h2>
        <p>It's possible to trigger the export to PDF from the keyboard by going
          to&nbsp;<em>Keyboard shortcuts</em>&nbsp;and assigning a key combination
          for the <code>exportAsPdf</code> action.</p>
