<h2><strong>Interactions</strong></h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Press the
              <img src="Split View_Split View_imag.png">button to the right of a note's title to open a new split to the right
              of it.
              <ul>
                <li>It is possible to have as many splits as desired, simply press again the
                  button.</li>
                <li>Only horizontal splits are possible, vertical or drag &amp; dropping is
                  not supported.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>When at least one split is open, press the
              <img src="Split View_3_Split View_im.png">button next to it to close it.</li>
            <li>Use the
              <img src="Split View_4_Split View_im.png">or the
              <img src="Split View_1_Split View_im.png">button to move around the splits.</li>
            <li>Each <a href="#root/_help_3seOhtN8uLIY">tab</a> has its own split view configuration
              (e.g. one tab can have two notes in a split view, whereas the others are
              one-note views).
              <ul>
                <li>The tab will indicate only the title of the main note (the first one in
                  the list).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Splits and the note tree &amp; hoisting</h2>
          <p>Clicking on the content of a split will focus that split. While focused,
            the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_oPVyFC7WL2Lp">Note Tree</a>&nbsp;will
            also indicate the note that is being edited.</p>
          <p>It is possible for each of the splits to have their own&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
            href="#root/_help_OR8WJ7Iz9K4U">Note Hoisting</a>.</p>
          <p>When a new split is created, it will share the same note hoisting as the
            previous one. An easy solution to this is to simply hoist the notes after
            the split is created.</p>
          <p>This is generally quite useful for reorganizing notes from one place to
            the other, by hoisting the old place in the first split and hoisting the
            new place to the second one. This will allow easy cut and paste without
            the tree jumping around from switching between notes.</p>
