        <p>Workspace is a concept built up on top of <a href="Note%20Hoisting.html">note hoisting</a>.
          It is based on the idea that a user has several distinct spheres of interest.
          An example might be "Personal" and "Work", these two spheres are quite
          distinct and don't interact together. When I focus on Work, I don't really
          care about personal notes.</p>
        <p>So far workspace consists of these features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><a href="Note%20Hoisting.html">note hoisting</a> - you can "zoom" into
              a workspace subtree to focus only on the relevant notes</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>easy entering of workspace: </p>
            <p>
              <img src="1_Workspace_image.png" alt="" />
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>visual identification of workspace in tabs:
              <br />
              <img src="Workspace_image.png" alt="" />
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
<h3>How to use workspaces</h3>

        <p>Let's say you have identified the workspaces and their subtrees. Define
          on the root of this subtree following labels:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>#workspace</code> - Marks this note as a workspace, button to enter
            the workspace is controlled by this</li>
          <li><code>#workspaceIconClass</code> - controls the box icon to be displayed
            in the tree and tabs, example <code>bx bx-home</code>. See <a href="https://boxicons.com/">https://boxicons.com/</a>
          </li>
          <li><code>#workspaceTabBackgroundColor</code> - Background color of the tab,
            use any CSS color format, e.g. "lightblue" or "#ddd". See <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp</a>.</li>
          <li><code>#workspaceCalendarRoot</code> - marking a note with this label will
            define a new per-workspace calendar. If there's no such note, the global
            calendar will be used.</li>
          <li><code>#workspaceTemplate</code> - This note will appear in the selection
            of available templates when creating a new note, but only when you are
            currently hoisted into a workspace containing this template.</li>
        </ul>
