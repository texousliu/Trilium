      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Trilium supports creating "code" notes, i.e. notes which contain some
          sort of formal code - be it programming language (C++, JavaScript), structured
          data (JSON, XML) or other types of codes (CSS etc.).</p>
        <p>This can be useful for a few things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>computer programmers can store code snippets as notes with syntax highlighting</li>
          <li>JavaScript code notes can be executed inside Trilium for some extra functionality
            <ul>
              <li>we call such JavaScript code notes "scripts" - see <a href="Code/Scripts.html">Scripts</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>JSON, XML etc. can be used as storage for structured data (typically used
            in conjunction with scripting)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For shorter snippets of code that can be embedded in <a href="Text.html">Text</a> notes,
          see <a href="Text/Code%20blocks.html">Code blocks</a>.</p>

        <h2>Adjusting the language of a code note</h2>
        <p>In the <a href="../Basic%20Concepts/UI%20Elements/Ribbon.html">Ribbon</a>,
          look for the <em>Note type</em> selector and click it to reveal the possible
          note types. Inside of it there will be a section called <em>Code</em>, select
          any one of the languages.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="1_Code_image.png" alt="">
        </p>
        <h2>Adjusting the list of languages</h2>
        <p>Trilium supports syntax highlighting for many languages, but by default
          displays only some of them. The supported languages can be adjusted by
          going to <a href="../Basic%20Concepts/UI%20Elements/Options.html">Options</a>,
          then <em>Code Notes</em> and looking for the <em>Available MIME types in the dropdown</em> section.
          Simply check any of the items to add them to the list, or un-check them
          to remove them from the list.</p>
        <p>Note that the list of languages is not immediately refreshed, you'd have
          to manually <a href="../Troubleshooting/Refreshing%20the%20application.html">refresh the application</a>.</p>
        <p>The list of languages is also shared with the <a href="Text/Code%20blocks.html">Code blocks</a> feature
          of <a href="Text.html">Text</a> notes.</p>
