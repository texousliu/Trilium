        <h2>External links</h2>

        <p>External link is general web link targeting some external web resource
          - e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea</a> is
          an external link to one Wikipedia page.</p>
        <p>External links are done through CKEditor native links. To create an external
          link, select text and press <code>CTRL-K</code> or wait for the "balloon"
          to appear and click link icon there.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="../../Attachments/create-external-link.gif" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>You can follow external link by either double clicking (will open new
          tab/window) it or right clicking on them and choosing "Open in new tab".</p>
        
<h2>Internal links to notes</h2>

        <p>Links to internal notes are created a bit differently. To create link
          to note at current cursor position, press <code>CTRL-L</code>.</p>
        <p>In the dialog you can see radio button to choose from different types
          of linking:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>link title mirrors the note's current title - this is sometimes also called
            "reference link". Title of such links cannot be changed, instead it is
            always mirroring the title of linked note. This way the link title is never
            outdated</li>
          <li>link title can be changed arbitrarily - this is the traditional hyperlink
            - you link to a particular note and can choose the link title</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <img src="../../Attachments/create-link-to-note.gif" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>You can follow the note link by double clicking it.</p>
        <p>Alternatively if you only wish to quickly preview the content, you can
          hover over the link and will see read only preview.</p>
        
<h3>In-place linking</h3>

        <p>Trilium also provides "inline" linking - type <code>@</code> and you'll
          see an autocomplete, just type few characters from the desired note title,
          press enter and you have a link.</p>
        
<h2>Note map</h2>

        <p>Trilium provides a visualisation of incoming and outgoing links for a
          particular note. See <a href="../../Advanced%20Usage/Note%20Map.html">note map</a> for
          details.</p>
