        <p>Trilium supports Mermaid, which adds support for various diagrams such
          as flowchart, sequence diagram, class diagram, state diagram, pie charts,
          etc., all using a text description of the chart instead of manually drawing
          the diagram.</p>
        <p>For the official documentation of Mermaid.js see <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/intro/">mermaid.js.org/intro/</a>.</p>
        <h2>Layouts</h2>
        <p>Depending on the chart being edited and user preference, there are two
          layouts supported by the Mermaid note type:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Horizontal, where the source code (editable part) is on the left side
            of the screen and the preview is to the right.</li>
          <li>Vertical, where the source code is at the bottom of the screen and the
            preview is at the top.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's possible to switch between the two layouts at any time by pressing
          the
          <img src="Mermaid Diagrams_image.png">icon in the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_XpOYSgsLkTJy">Floating buttons</a>&nbsp;area.</p>
        <h2>Interaction</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The source code of the diagram (in Mermaid format) is displayed on the
            left or bottom side of the note (depending on the layout).
            <ul>
              <li>Changing the diagram code will refresh automatically the diagram.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The preview of the diagram is displayed at the right or top side of the
            note (depending on the layout):
            <ul>
              <li>There are dedicated buttons at the bottom-right of the preview to control
                the zoom in, zoom out or re-center the diagram:
                <img src="1_Mermaid Diagrams_image.png">
              </li>
              <li>The preview can be moved around by holding the left mouse button and dragging.</li>
              <li>Zooming can also be done by using the scroll wheel.</li>
              <li>The zoom and position on the preview will remain fixed as the diagram
                changes, to be able to work more easily with large diagrams.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The size of the source/preview panes can be adjusted by hovering over
            the border between them and dragging it with the mouse.</li>
          <li>In the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_XpOYSgsLkTJy">Floating buttons</a>&nbsp;area:
            <ul>
              <li>The source/preview can be laid out left-right or bottom-top via the <em>Move editing pane to the left / bottom</em> option.</li>
              <li>Press <em>Lock editing</em> to automatically mark the note as read-only.
                In this mode, the code pane is hidden and the diagram is displayed full-size.
                Similarly, press <em>Unlock editing</em> to mark a read-only note as editable.</li>
              <li>Press the <em>Copy image reference to the clipboard</em> to be able to insert
                the image representation of the diagram into a text note. See&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
                href="#root/_help_0Ofbk1aSuVRu">Image references</a>&nbsp;for more information.</li>
              <li>Press the <em>Export diagram as SVG</em> to download a scalable/vector rendering
                of the diagram. Can be used to present the diagram without degrading when
                zooming.</li>
              <li>Press the <em>Export diagram as PNG</em> to download a normal image (at
                1x scale, raster) of the diagram. Can be used to send the diagram in more
                traditional channels such as e-mail.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Errors in the diagram</h2>
        <p>If there is an error in the source code, the error will be displayed in
          an information pane.</p>
        <p>During the state of an error, the diagram will no longer be rendered and
          the previously working diagram will remain in the preview section.</p>
