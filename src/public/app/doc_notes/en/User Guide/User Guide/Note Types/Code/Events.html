        <p><a href="../../Scripting.html">Script</a> notes can be triggered by events.
          Note that these are backend events and thus relation need to point to the
          "JS backend" code note.</p>
        <h2>Global events</h2>
        <p>Global events are attached to the script note via label. Simply create
          e.g. "run" label with some of these values and script note will be executed
          once the event occurs.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>run</code>
            <ul>
              <li><code>frontendStartup</code> - executes on frontend upon startup</li>
              <li><code>mobileStartup</code> - executes on mobile frontend upon startup</li>
              <li><code>backendStartup</code> - executes on backend upon startup</li>
              <li><code>hourly</code> - executes once an hour on backend</li>
              <li><code>daily</code> - executes once a day on backend</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Entity events</h2>
        <p>Other events are bound to some entity, these are defined as <a href="../../Advanced%20Usage/Attributes.html">relations</a> -
          meaning that script is triggered only if note has this script attached
          to it through relations (or it can inherit it).</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>runOnNoteCreation</code> - executes when note is created on backend</li>
          <li><code>runOnNoteTitleChange</code> - executes when note title is changed
            (includes note creation as well)</li>
          <li><code>runOnNoteContentChange</code> - executes when note content is changed
            (includes note creation as well).</li>
          <li><code>runOnNoteChange</code> - executes when note is changed (includes
            note creation as well)</li>
          <li><code>runOnNoteDeletion</code> - executes when note is being deleted</li>
          <li><code>runOnBranchCreation</code> - executes when a branch is created. Branch
            is a link between parent note and child note and is created e.g. when cloning
            or moving note.</li>
          <li><code>runOnBranchChange</code> (since v0.62) - executes when a branch is
            changed - either expanded status or prefix are changed.</li>
          <li><code>runOnBranchDeletion</code> - executes when a branch is delete. Branch
            is a link between parent note and child note and is deleted e.g. when moving
            note (old branch/link is deleted).</li>
          <li><code>runOnChildNoteCreation</code> - executes when new note is created
            under <em>this</em> note</li>
          <li><code>runOnAttributeCreation</code> - executes when new attribute is created
            under <em>this</em> note</li>
          <li><code>runOnAttributeChange</code> - executes when attribute is changed
