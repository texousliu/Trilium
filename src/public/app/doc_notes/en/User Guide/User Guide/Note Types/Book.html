        <p>A <strong>Book Note</strong> in Trilium is a special type of <a href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Notes.html">note</a> designed
          to display the contents of its child notes sequentially, creating a linear,
          book-like reading experience. This format is particularly useful for viewing
          multiple smaller notes in a cohesive, continuous manner.</p>

        <p>In the example above, the "node.js" note on the left panel contains several
          child notes. The right panel displays the content of these child notes
          as a single continuous document.</p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>The Book Note format compiles the contents of all child notes into one
          continuous view. This makes it ideal for reading extensive information
          broken into smaller, manageable segments.</p>
        <p>It uses the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Notes/Note%20List.html">Note List</a>&nbsp;mechanism
          to display the child notes, allowing the use of any of the view types (grid,
          list, calendar).</p>
        <p>To adjust the view type, see the dedicated <em>Book</em> tab in the&nbsp;
