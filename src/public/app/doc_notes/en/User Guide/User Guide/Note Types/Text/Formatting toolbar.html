      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Trilium allows two different editing experiences for text notes, based
          on your preference.</p>
        <p>To do so, go to <a href="../../Basic%20Concepts/UI%20Elements/Options.html">Options</a> and
          look for the <em>Text Notes</em> section. There is a corresponding section
          called <em>Formatting toolbar</em>.</p>
        <h2>Floating</h2>
        <p>The floating bar is a more minimalist option, in which the formatting
          is hidden behind two different popups.</p>
        <h3>Block-level popup</h3>
        <p>The first popup is the block-level popup. This will appear to the left
          of the current paragraph you are currently editing, as a sequence of dots:
          <br>
          <img src="1_Formatting toolbar_image.png" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>Clicking this popup will reveal the formatting options that are specific
          to the entire paragraph, such as setting a heading, lists, tables, etc.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="3_Formatting toolbar_image.png" alt="">
        </p>
        <h3>Inline popup</h3>
        <p>The inline popup appears automatically when selecting a text:</p>
        <p>
          <img src="Formatting toolbar_image.png" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>All the options here apply only to the selected portion of text, such
          as changing the font size, or making the text bold.</p>
        <h2>Fixed</h2>
        <p>The fixed formatting offers a more traditional editing paradigm, usually
          useful if a lot of formatting is needed.</p>
        <p>All the options are combined into a single toolbar that will appear as
          part of the <a href="../../Basic%20Concepts/UI%20Elements/Ribbon.html">Ribbon</a>.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="2_Formatting toolbar_image.png" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>By default, if the toolbar does not fit on the screen, the rest of the
          options will be grouped into a single option at the end. It is possible
          to display items on multiple lines by checking the corresponding option
          in the <em>Formatting toolbar</em> section.</p>
