        <p>Relation map is a type of&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts/Note.html">Note</a>&nbsp;which
          visualizes notes and their <a href="../Advanced%20Usage/Attributes.html">relations</a>.
          See an example:</p>
        <h2>Development process demo</h2>
        <p>This is a basic example how you can create simple diagram using relation
          maps:</p>
        <p>
          <img src="../Attachments/relation-map-dev-process.png">
        </p>
        <p>And this is how you can create it:</p>
        <p>
          <img src="Relation Map_relation-map-.gif">
        </p>
        <p>We start completely from scratch by first creating new note called "Development
          process" and changing its type to "Relation map". After that we create
          new notes one by one and place them by clicking into the map. We also drag
          <a
          href="../Advanced%20Usage/Attributes.html">relations</a>between notes and name them. That's all!</p>
        <p>Items on the map - "Specification", "Development", "Testing" and "Demo"
          are actually notes which have been created under "Development process"
          note - you can click on them and write some content. Connections between
          notes are called "<a href="../Advanced%20Usage/Attributes.html">relations</a>".</p>
        <h2>Family demo</h2>
        <p>This is more complicated demo using some advanced concepts. Resulting
          diagram is here:</p>
        <p>
          <img src="../Attachments/relation-map-family.png">
        </p>
        <p>This is how you get to it:</p>
        <p>
          <img src="../Attachments/relation-map-family-demo.gif">
        </p>
        <p>There are several steps here:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>we start with empty relation map and two existing notes representing Prince
            Philip and Queen Elizabeth II. These two notes already have "isPartnerOf"
            <a
            href="../Advanced%20Usage/Attributes.html">relations</a>defined.
              <ul>
                <li>There are actually two "inverse" relations (one from Philip to Elizabeth
                  and one from Elizabeth to Philip)</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>we drag both notes to relation map and place to suitable position. Notice
            how the existing "isPartnerOf" relations are displayed.</li>
          <li>now we create new note - we name it "Prince Charles" and place it on the
            relation map by clicking on the desired position. The note is by default
            created under the relation map note (visible in the note tree on the left).</li>
          <li>we create two new relations "isChildOf" targeting both Philip and Elizabeth
            <ul>
              <li>now there's something unexpected - we can also see the relation to display
                another "hasChild" relation. This is because there's a <a href="../Advanced%20Usage/Attributes/Promoted%20Attributes.html">relation definition</a> which
                puts "isChildOf" as an "<a href="../Advanced%20Usage/Attributes/Promoted%20Attributes.html">inverse</a>"
                relation of "hasChildOf" (and vice versa) and thus it is created automatically.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>we create another note for Princess Diana and create "isPartnerOf" relation
            from Charles. Again notice how the relation has arrows both ways - this
            is because "isPartnerOf" definition specifies its inverse relation as again
            "isPartnerOf" so the opposite relation is created automatically.</li>
          <li>as the last step we pan &amp; zoom the map to fit better to window dimensions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Relation definitions mentioned above come from "Person template" note
          which is assigned to any child of "My Family Tree" relation note. You can
          play with the whole thing in the <a href="../Advanced%20Usage/Database.html">demo notes</a>.</p>
        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>You can specify which relations should be displayed with comma delimited
          names of relations in <code>displayRelations</code> label.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can specify comma delimited list of relation names
          in <code>hideRelations</code> which will display all relations, except for
          the ones defined in the label.</p>
