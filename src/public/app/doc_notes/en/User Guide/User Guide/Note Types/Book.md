# Book
A **Book Note** in Trilium is a special type of [note](../Basic%20Concepts/Note.md) designed to display the contents of its child notes sequentially, creating a linear, book-like reading experience. This format is particularly useful for viewing multiple smaller notes in a cohesive, continuous manner.

In the example above, the "node.js" note on the left panel contains several child notes. The right panel displays the content of these child notes as a single continuous document.

## Features

### Linear Display

The Book Note format compiles the contents of all child notes into one continuous view. This makes it ideal for reading extensive information broken into smaller, manageable segments.

### Grid View Option

Trilium also offers a "Grid View" option within the Book Note properties. This view presents the child notes in a grid format, allowing for a more visual navigation experience.

Switching between these views can be easily managed through the Book Note's settings (or `viewType` attribute), allowing users to choose the format that best suits their reading or navigation preferences.
