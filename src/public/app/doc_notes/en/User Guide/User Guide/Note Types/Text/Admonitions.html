        <p>Admonitions are a way to highlight information to the reader. Other names
          for it include <em>call-outs</em> and <em>info/warning/alert boxes</em>.</p>
        <h2>Inserting a new admonition</h2>
        <h3>From the UI</h3>
        <p>In the Formatting toolbar:</p>
        <p>
          <img src="Admonitions_image.png">
        </p>
        <h3>Via the keyboard</h3>
        <p>It's possible to insert an admonition simply by typing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>!!! note</code>
          </li>
          <li><code>!!! tip</code>
          </li>
          <li><code>!!! important</code>
          </li>
          <li><code>!!! caution</code>
          </li>
          <li><code>!!! warning</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to that, it's also possible to type <code>!!!</code>  followed
          by any text, case in which a default admonition type will appear (note)
          with the entered text inside it.</p>
        <h2>Interaction</h2>
        <p>By design, admonitions act very similar to block quotes.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Selecting a text and pressing the admonition button will turn that text
            into an admonition.</li>
          <li>If selecting multiple admonitions, pressing the admonition button will
            automatically merge them into one.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Inside an admonition:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pressing <kbd>Backspace</kbd> while the admonition is empty will remove
            it.</li>
          <li>Pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will start a new paragraph. Pressing it twice
            will exit out of the admonition.</li>
          <li>Headings and other block content including tables can be inserted inside
            the admonition.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Types of admonitions</h2>
        <p>There are currently five types of admonitions: <em>Note</em>, <em>Tip</em>, <em>Important</em>, <em>Caution</em>, <em>Warning</em>.</p>
        <p>These types were inspired by GitHub's support for this feature and there
          are currently no plans for adjusting it or allowing the user to customize
          them.</p>
        <h2>Markdown support</h2>
        <p>The Markdown syntax for admonitions as supported by Trilium is the one
          that GitHub uses, which is as follows:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-gfm">&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This is a note.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; This is a tip.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; This is a very important information.

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; This is a caution.</code></pre>
        <p>There are currently no plans of supporting alternative admonition syntaxes
          such as <code>!!! note</code>.</p>
