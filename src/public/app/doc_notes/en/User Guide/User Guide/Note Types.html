      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>One core features of Trilium is that it supports multiple types of notes,
          depending on the need.</p>
        <h2>Creating a new note with a different type via the note tree</h2>
        <p>The default note type in Trilium (e.g. when creating a new note) is&nbsp;
          <a
          class="reference-link" href="Note%20Types/Text.html">Text</a>, since it's for general use.</p>
        <p>To create a new note of a different type, head to the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
          href="Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Note%20Tree.html">Note Tree</a>&nbsp;and
          right click an existing note where to place the new one and select:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Insert note after</em>, to put the new note underneath the one selected.</li>
          <li><em>Insert child note</em>, to insert the note as a child of the selected
            note.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <img src="Note Types_image.png">
        </p>
        <h2>Creating a new note of a different type via add link or new tab</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>When adding a <a href="Note%20Types/Text/Links.html">link</a> in a&nbsp;
            <a
            class="reference-link" href="Note%20Types/Text.html">Text</a>&nbsp;note, type the desired title of the new note and press Enter.
              Afterwards the type of the note will be asked.</li>
          <li>Similarly, when creating a new tab, type the desired title and press Enter.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Changing the type of a note</h2>
        <p>It is possible to change the type of a note after it has been created
          via the <em>Basic Properties</em> tab in the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
          href="Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Ribbon.html">Ribbon</a>.
          Note that it's generally a good idea to change the note type only if the
          note is empty. Can also be used to edit the <a href="Advanced%20Usage/Note%20source.html">source of a note</a>.</p>
        <h2>Supported note types</h2>
        <p>The following note types are supported by Trilium:</p>
