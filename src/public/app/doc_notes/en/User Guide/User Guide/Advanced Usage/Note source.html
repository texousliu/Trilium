        <h2>Understanding the source code of the different notes</h2>
        <p>Internally, the structure of the content of each note is different based
          on the&nbsp;<a href="../Note%20Types.html">Note Types</a>.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#root/_hidden/_options/_optionsTextNotes">Text Notes</a>&nbsp;are
            represented internally as HTML, using the&nbsp;<a href="Technologies%20used/CKEditor.html">CKEditor</a>&nbsp;representation.
            Note that due to the custom plugins, some HTML elements are specific to
            Trilium only, for example the admonitions.</li>
          <li><a href="#root/_hidden/_options/_optionsCodeNotes">Code Notes</a>&nbsp;are
            plain text and are represented internally as-is.</li>
          <li><a href="../Note%20Types/Geo%20map.html">Geo map</a>&nbsp;notes contain
            only minimal information (viewport, zoom) as a JSON.</li>
          <li><a href="../Note%20Types/Canvas.html">Canvas</a>&nbsp;notes are represented
            as JSON, with Trilium's own information alongside with&nbsp;<a href="Technologies%20used/Excalidraw.html">Excalidraw</a>'s
            internal JSON representation format.</li>
          <li><a href="../Note%20Types/Mind%20Map.html">Mind Map</a>&nbsp;notes are
            represented as JSON, with the internal format of&nbsp;<a href="Technologies%20used/MindElixir.html">MindElixir</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that some information is also stored as&nbsp;<a href="../Attachments">Attachments</a>.
          For example&nbsp;<a href="../Note%20Types/Canvas.html">Canvas</a>&nbsp;notes
          use the attachments feature to store the custom libraries, and alongside
          with&nbsp;<a href="../Note%20Types/Mind%20Map.html">Mind Map</a>&nbsp;and
          other similar note types it stores an SVG representation of the content
          for use in other features such as including in other notes, shared notes,
          etc.</p>
        <p>Here's part of the HTML representation of this note, as it's stored in
          the database (but prettified).</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">&lt;h2&gt;
	Understanding the source code of the different notes
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Internally, the structure of the content of each note is different based on the&amp;nbsp;
	&lt;a class="reference-link" href="../Note%20Types.html"&gt;
		Note Types
	&lt;/a&gt;
	.
&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
        <h2>Viewing the source code</h2>
        <p>It is possible to view the source code of a note by pressing the contextual
          menu in&nbsp;<a href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Note%20buttons.html">Note buttons</a>&nbsp;and
          selecting <em>Note source</em>.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="Note source_image.png">
        </p>
        <p>The source code will be displayed in a new tab.</p>
        <p>For some note types, such as text notes, the source code is also formatted
          in order to be more easily readable.</p>
        <h2>Modifying the source code</h2>
        <p>It is possible to modify the source code of a note directly, however not
          via the <em>Note source</em> functionality.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To do so:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Change the note type from the real note type (e.g. Canvas, Geo Type) to
            Code (plain text) or the corresponding format such as JSON or HTML.</li>
          <li>Confirm the warning about changing the note type.</li>
          <li>The source code will appear, make the necessary modifications.</li>
          <li>Change the note type back to the real note type.</li>
        </ol>
        <aside class="admonition warning">
          <p>Depending on the changes made, there is a risk that the note will not
            render properly. It's best to save a revision before making any big changes.</p>
          <p>If the note does not render properly, modify the source code again or
            revert to a prior revision. Since the error handling for unexpected changes
            might not always be perfect, it be required to refresh the application.</p>
