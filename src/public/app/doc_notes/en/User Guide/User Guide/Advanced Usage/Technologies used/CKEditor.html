        <h2>Editor core</h2>
        <p>The CKEditor is the WYSIWYG (standing for What You See Is What You Get)
          editor behind&nbsp;<a href="#root/_help_iPIMuisry3hd">Text</a>&nbsp;notes.</p>
        <p>Their website is <a href="https://ckeditor.com/">ckeditor.com</a>.</p>
        <p>CKEditor by itself is a commercial product, but the core is open-source.
          As described in <a href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/index.html">its documentation</a>,
          the editor supports quite a large number of features. Do note that not
          all the features are enabled in Trilium.</p>
        <h2>Premium features</h2>
        <p>Some features are marked as premium in the CKEditor feature set. This
          means that they cannot be used without a license.</p>
        <p>Trilium cannot benefit from any of these premium features as they require
          a commercial license, however we are in discussions with the CKEditor team
          to allow us to use a subset of these premium features such as <a href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/slash-commands.html">Slash commands</a>.</p>
        <h2>Plugins</h2>
        <p>The CKEditor ecosystem is quite extensible, in the sense that custom plugins
          can be written to extend the functionality of the editor beyond its original
          scope.</p>
        <p>Trilium makes use of such features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The math feature is added by a version of <a href="https://github.com/isaul32/ckeditor5-math">isaul32/ckeditor5-math: Math feature for CKEditor 5.</a> modified
            by us to fit our needs.</li>
          <li>We also make use of modified upstream plugins such as <a href="https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-mermaid">ckeditor/ckeditor5-mermaid</a> to
            allow inline Mermaid code.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/mlewand/ckeditor5-keyboard-marker">mlewand/ckeditor5-keyboard-marker: Plugin adds support for the keyboard input element (<code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>) to CKEditor 5.</a>
          </li>
          <li>A modified version of <a href="https://github.com/ThomasAitken/ckeditor5-footnotes">ThomasAitken/ckeditor5-footnotes: Footnotes plugin for CKEditor5</a> to
            allow footnotes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Apart from that, Trilium also has its own set of specific plugins such
          as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_2x0ZAX9ePtzV">Cut to subnote</a>
          </li>
          <li><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_nBAXQFj20hS1">Include Note</a>
          </li>
          <li>Mentions, for linking pages.</li>
          <li><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_Oau6X9rCuegd">Markdown</a>
          </li>
          <li><a href="#root/_help_QEAPj01N5f7w">Reference links</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
