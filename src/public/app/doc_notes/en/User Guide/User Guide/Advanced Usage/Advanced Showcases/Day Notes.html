       <h1 data-trilium-h1>Day Notes</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>A common pattern in note-taking is that a lot of notes will be centered
          around a certain date - e.g. you have some tasks which needs to be done
          on a certain date, you have meeting minutes from a certain date, you have
          your thoughts etc. and it all revolves around a date on which they occurred.
          For this reason, it makes sense to create a certain "day workspace" which
          will centralize all those notes relevant for a certain date.</p>
        <p>For this, Trilium provides a concept of "day note". Trilium semi-automatically
          generates a single note for each day. Under this note you can save all
          those relevant notes.</p>
        <p>Select an existing day note, and the menubar contains a calendar widget.
          Select any day to create a note for that day.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>This pattern works well also because of <a href="../../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Notes/Cloning%20Notes.html">Cloning Notes</a> functionality
          - note can appear in multiple places in the note tree, so besides appearing
          under day note, it can also be categorized into other notes.</p>
        <h2>Demo</h2>
        <p>
          <img src="Day Notes_image.png">
        </p>
        <p>You can see the structure of day notes appearing under "Journal" note
          - there's a note for the whole year 2017, under it, you have "12 - December"
          which then contains "18 - Monday". This is our "day note" which contains
          some text in its content and also has some child notes (some of them are
          from <a href="Task%20Manager.html">Task manager</a>).</p>
        <p>You can also notice how this day note has <a href="../Attributes/Promoted%20Attributes.html">promoted attribute</a> "weight"
          where you can track your daily weight. This data is then used in <a href="Weight%20Tracker.html">Weight tracker</a>.</p>
        <h2>Templates</h2>
        <p>Trilium provides <a href="../Attributes/Template.html">template</a> functionality,
          and it could be used together with day notes.</p>
        <p>You can define one of the following relations on the root of the journal
          (identified by <code>#calendarRoot</code> label):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>yearTemplate</li>
          <li>monthTemplate</li>
          <li>dateTemplate</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of these are relations. When Trilium creates a new note for year or
          month or date, it will take a look at the root and attach a corresponding <code>~template</code> relation
          to the newly created role. Using this, you can e.g. create your daily template
          with e.g. checkboxes for daily routine etc.</p>
        <h2>Date pattern</h2>
        <p>It's possible to customize the title of generated date notes by defining
          a <code>#datePattern</code> label on a root calendar note (identified by <code>#calendarRoot</code> label).
          Following are possible values:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>{dayInMonthPadded} - {weekDay}</code> day notes are named e.g. "24
            - Monday"</li>
          <li><code>{dayInMonthPadded}: {weekDay3}</code> day notes are named e.g. "24:
            Mon"</li>
          <li><code>{dayInMonthPadded}: {weekDay2}</code> day notes are named e.g. "24:
            Mo"</li>
          <li><code>{isoDate} - {weekDay}</code> day notes are named e.g. "2020-12-24
            - Monday"</li>
          <li><code>{ordinal}</code> is replaced with the ordinal date (e.g. 1st, 2nd,
            3rd) etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Month pattern</h2>
        <p>It is also possible to customize the title of generated month notes through
          the <code>#monthPattern</code> attribute, much like <code>#datePattern</code>.
          The options are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>{isoMonth}</code> results in an ISO 8061 formatted month (e.g. "2025-03"
            for March 2025)</li>
          <li><code>{monthNumberPadded}</code> results in a number like <code>09</code> for
            September, and <code>11</code> for November</li>
          <li><code>{month}</code> results in the full month name (e.g. <code>September</code> or <code>October</code>)</li>
          <li><code>{shortMonth3}</code> is replaced with the first 3 letters of the
            month, e.g. Jan, Feb, etc.</li>
          <li><code>{shortMonth4}</code> is replaced with the first 4 letters of the
            month, e.g. Sept, Octo, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The default is <code>{monthNumberPadded} - {month}</code>
        </p>
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>Trilium has some special support for day notes in the form of <a href="https://triliumnext.github.io/Notes/backend_api/BackendScriptApi.html">backend Script API</a> -
          see e.g. getDayNote() function.</p>
        <p>Day (and year, month) notes are created with a label - e.g. <code>#dateNote="2018-08-16"</code> this
          can then be used by other scripts to add new notes to day note etc.</p>
        <p>Journal also has relation <code>child:child:child:template=Day template</code> (see
          [[attribute inheritance]]) which effectively adds [[template]] to day notes
          (grand-grand-grand children of Journal).</p>
