## 💡 Key highlights

*   [Allow changing note color from tree](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/issues/4137) by @adoriandoran
*   More Collection types can now be printed or exported to PDF:
    *   List collections which will render in a book-like fashion with all its children and preserving the note hierarchy, with functional table of contents and links (for PDFs).
    *   Table collections will now render a printable table.
    *   See [documentation](https://docs.triliumnotes.org/user-guide/concepts/notes/printing-and-pdf-export#printing-multiple-notes) for more info.

    *   The number of items in each column is now displayed.

*   **Breaking change**: `#calendar:color` was completely removed in favor of the global `#color` attribute.
