# v0.90.12
## 💡 Key highlights

*   Now it is possible to have a fixed toolbar for editing text notes instead of the standard floating one, see [Classic editor for text notes (with fixed toolbar)](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/571) for more information.
*   Syntax highlight in code blocks in editable and read-only text notes (via Highlight.js), heavily based on [antoniotejada](https://github.com/antoniotejada)'s [Trilium-SyntaxHighlightWidget](https://github.com/antoniotejada/Trilium-SyntaxHighlightWidget).
