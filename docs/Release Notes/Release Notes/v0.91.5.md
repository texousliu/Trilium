# v0.91.5
## 💡 Key highlights

*   We now provide binaries to run the server on Linux on ARM without Docker (e.g. on a Raspberry Pi, thanks to @perfectra1n ).
*   [Introducing a map note type](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/1017)
*   Add ability to set Trilium configuration variables via ENV variables by @pano9000 and @perfectra1n
*   Quite a few mobile improvements have been done (**kindly waiting for bug reports**)
    
    *   On mobile the horizontal layout (with the launcher bar displayed at the top of the screen instead of on the left side) is now enforced.
        *   This allows for more real estate for the content of the note and simplifies the mobile layout.
    *   The launch bar has also been moved at the bottom, to be inline with modern application layouts.
    *   Restructured the tree as a sidebar which is triggered via a button on the left side of the title bar.
    *   The sidebar can also be triggered by swiping to the right on the left side of the screen. _Still some quirks to address on both iOS and Android due to their weird back button gesture_.
    *   Improved the positioning of the bottom bar and of the editor toolbar.
    *   Tabs have been enabled. Currently we are using the same implementation as on desktop, which might have a few quirks on mobile.
    *   Jump to note is now available.
    *   The mobile view now has its own launch bar configuration with its own launch bar buttons. For now only a few have been enabled. **Feel free to request any button from the desktop should you require it.**
    *   Now it's possible to insert footnotes in CKEditor, thanks to a fork of [ThomasAitken/ckeditor5-footnotes](https://github.com/ThomasAitken/ckeditor5-footnotes).
    *   It's also possible to create inline Mermaid diagrams into text notes.
*   The launcher bar can now be placed at the top instead of the left of the screen, with a full-width tab bar. See [#654](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/654) for more information.
*   [A new theme is introduced called “TriliumNext"](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/661) by @adoriandoran and @eliandoran. Settings on this theme are now displayed in a card layout. Redesigned tree action buttons.
*   [Native title bar buttons](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/702) when native title bar is off for Windows and macOS.
*   On Windows, on the TriliumNext theme there are window transparency effects if running under Windows, see [Mica (Windows transparency effects)](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/717) for screenshots. Unfortunately, it is plagued by a few bugs with Electron (the library we are using for the desktop application), see the link for more information.
*   Updated Docker builds to Node 22. **Be on the lookout for any potential issues, especially for less-tested platforms such as ARM.**
