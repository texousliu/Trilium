# v0.90.5-beta
This release brings a few quality-of-life improvements, as well as bugfixes. The main highlight, however, is the increased support for localization as well as a new note type.

## 🌍 Internationalization

Preliminary support for internationalization has been added, thanks to the efforts of `@Nriver`. More specifically, the following languages now have a partial translation:

*   Spanish by `@hasecilu`
*   Chinese by `@Nriver`
*   Romanian.

Note that only the client has been translated so far and there are still a lot of tasks to handle before the application is fully translated.

## 💡 New note type: Mind map

Mind maps are usually a fast method to write down ideas and do brainstorming with a team. TriliumNext introduces this new note type with the help of [Mind Elixir](https://mind-elixir.com/), an open-source library.

Note that the integration is still in its infancy, so there might be bugs and a lack of feature until it is stabilized. The library itself supports quite a few features that are not implemented yet in Trilium: math expressions using KaTeX, images, links. Those might be implemented along the way, provided they are needed by users.

> **Note**: For the note type to fully work (such as shared notes), it is ideal to update the server instance as well, if you are using one.

## ⚙️ Builds

The internal build tooling has been updated, resulting in the following changes:

*   For macOS users there is now a `.dmg` installation method as well. `@JYC333`
    *   There is also an ARM-native version for macOS that can be used, however it will require [additional steps to get it running](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/issues/329) due to the lack of notarization (to bypass the “TriliumNext Notes.app” is damaged error).
*   For both Windows and Linux we now have `amd64` builds as well.
    *   Please note these versions are not being actively tested due to lack of equipment, so feel free to raise any issues you might be encountering.

On the Docker side, [brought back Alpine-based Docker containers for amd64](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/366) by `@perfectrain`.
