# v0.91.1-beta
## 💡 Key highlights

*   The launcher bar can now be placed at the top instead of the left of the screen, with a full-width tab bar. See [#654](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/654) for more information.
*   [A new theme is introduced called “TriliumNext"](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/661) by @adoriandoran and @eliandoran. Settings on this theme are now displayed in a card layout. Redesigned tree action buttons.
*   [Native title bar buttons](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/702) when native title bar is off for Windows and macOS.
    
*   On Windows, on the TriliumNext theme there are window transparency effects if running under Windows, see [Mica (Windows transparency effects)](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/717) for screenshots. Unfortunately, it is plagued by a few bugs with Electron (the library we are using for the desktop application), see the link for more information.
