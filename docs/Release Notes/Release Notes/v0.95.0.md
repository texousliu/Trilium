> [!CAUTION]
> Sync version has been increased, so update of both the client and server are necessary.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For canvas notes, the “Mermaid to Excalidraw” feature is no longer functional for now since it relies on an old version of Mermaid diagrams. To avoid having a large library duplicated, we had to let go of this feature. If it's an important feature to you, let us know.

## 💡 Key highlights

*   Improvements to the shared notes functionality:
    *   A new default theme was introduced called Trilium.Rocks (original development by @zerebos) and adapted to our project. New features from this theme include: search, collapsible tree, light/dark mode, mobile mobile.
    *   Basic syntax highlighting for code blocks has been added, but only if the language is explicitly specified.
    *   Note icons are now displayed in the share tree.
    *   Math equations are now rendered in text notes.
