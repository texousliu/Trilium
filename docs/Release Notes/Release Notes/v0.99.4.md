*   [Many UI improvements](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/pull/7655) by @adoriandoran
    *   **Zen Mode Overhaul** – improved the appearance and layout of the Zen Mode view. The content of text notes is now vertically aligned, with a slightly larger font size to enhance focus. The content width now follows the “Max content width” option. The formatting toolbar has been moved to the bottom and remains full-width even in split-note view. You can now activate editing mode for read-only notes directly from Zen Mode. A launcher for Zen Mode has also been added to the Launchbar (hidden by default, to add it to the Launchbar: right-click the toolbar, choose Configure Launchbar, then right-click Zen Mode and select Move to visible launchers).
    *   **“Max content width” option and content alignment improvements** – the internal behavior of the “Max content width” option has been rewritten. Content now aligns to the left by default (or to the right in RTL mode). To center the content instead, enable “Keep content centered” under Options → Appearance. The note title and ribbon now always span the full width, and the scrollbar stays aligned with the edge. Changing the width value no longer requires restarting the front-end.
    *   **Read-only note alert bar** – to better highlight that a note is read-only and make editing more intuitive, a message bar now appears at the top of the note with a button to enable editing. The floating pencil button used previously for this purpose has been removed. An “Edit” command has also been added to the note menu.
    *   **Quick Edit dialog background tinting** – the background tint of the Quick Edit dialog now reflects the note’s color attribute.
    *   **Extra Mica effect** – on Windows 11, the desktop app now applies the Mica background effect to settings pages, the right pane, and empty tabs.
