## 💡 Key highlights

*   A new layout was introduced which heavily changes both existing UI elements, as well as adds some new ones (by @eliandoran and @adoriandoran, with special thanks for @rom1dep for the valuable suggestions).
    *   The goal of this new layout is to modernize the application and to make it more intuitive but at the same time to reduce clutter.
    *   See [documentation](https://docs.triliumnotes.org/user-guide/concepts/ui/new-layout) of the changes and the new UI elements.
    *   Notes can be more easily navigated across the hierarchy using the breadcrumbs displayed underneath the tab bar.
    *   The old layout can still be used, for now. Feedback is welcome.
*   Near the tab bar now there are [built-in buttons to go the previous or the next note in history](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/pull/8003/files) (only if the back/forward buttons are not already placed in the launch bar).
*   **Scripting overhaul:** Custom widgets and Render note can now be written in Preact using JSX instead of the legacy format (jQuery + custom component framework). For more information, see [documentation on Preact in Trilium](https://docs.triliumnotes.org/user-guide/scripts/frontend-basics/Preact).
