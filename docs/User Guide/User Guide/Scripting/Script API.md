# Script API
For [script code notes](../Scripting.md), Trilium offers an API that gives them access to various features of the application.

There are two APIs:

*   One for the front-end scripts: <a class="reference-link" href="Script%20API/Frontend%20API">Frontend API</a>
*   One for the back-end scripts: <a class="reference-link" href="Script%20API/Backend%20API.dat">Backend API</a>

In both cases, the API resides in a global variable, `api`, that can be used anywhere in the script.

For example, to display a message to the user the following front-end script can be used:

```
api.showMessage("Hello world.");
```
