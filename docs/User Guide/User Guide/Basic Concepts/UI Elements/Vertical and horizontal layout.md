# Vertical and horizontal layout
## Layouts

Trilium supports two different layouts, based on your preference.

### Vertical layout

The vertical layout is Trilium's original layout:

*   The [Launcher Bar](Launcher%20Bar.md) is positioned on the left side of the screen, with buttons being laid out vertically.
*   The tab bar is at the top, but to the right of the [Note Tree](Note%20Tree.md).
*   The [Quick search](Quick%20search.md) is at the top of the [Note Tree](Note%20Tree.md).
*   The [Note Tree](Note%20Tree.md) can be collapsed by pressing the ![](6_Vertical%20and%20horizontal%20la.png) button at the bottom of the [Launcher Bar](Launcher%20Bar.md).
*   The [Global menu](Global%20menu.md) can be accessed via the ![](5_Vertical%20and%20horizontal%20la.png) icon at the top of the [Launcher Bar](Launcher%20Bar.md).

### Horizontal layout

The horizontal layout is a more traditional layout, since it bears similarity with other applications. In this mode:

*   The [Launcher Bar](Launcher%20Bar.md) is at the top of the screen, with the buttons laid horizontally.
*   The tab bar is at the top of the screen, but now covers the entirety of the width, allowing for more tabs to be displayed at once.
*   The [Quick search](Quick%20search.md) is now part of the [Launcher Bar](Launcher%20Bar.md). It can be moved around according to preference and even removed if needed.
*   The [Note Tree](Note%20Tree.md) can be collapsed by pressing the small ![](2_Vertical%20and%20horizontal%20la.png) button to the left of the first tab.
*   The [Global menu](Global%20menu.md) can be accessed via the ![](1_Vertical%20and%20horizontal%20la.png) button at the end of the [Launcher Bar](Launcher%20Bar.md).

## Changing the layout

Go to [Settings](#root/_hidden/_lbRoot/_lbVisibleLaunchers/_lbSettings) and look for the _Appearance_ option on the left. Then look for the _Layout_ section, where there is the possibility to switch between the two available layouts.

Selecting an option will immediately apply the new layout by reloading the window.
