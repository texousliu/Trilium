# Internal (reference) links
Internal links are links to other notes within Trilium.

You can open an internal link by clicking it. You can also see a read-only preview of an internal link's contents by hovering over it.

## Inserting internal links

Internal links can be created at the current position in a text note by:

1.  Pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> or the <img src="Internal (reference) links.png" width="20" height="17"> button underneath the <img src="1_Internal (reference) links.png" width="34" height="16"> menu in the <a class="reference-link" href="../Formatting%20toolbar.md">Formatting toolbar</a>.
2.  Searching for the title of the desired note to link. It's also possible to create new notes from this dialog by typing a non-existing note title and selecting _Create and link child note_.

There are two link types which you can select when creating the link to the note:

1.  _Link title mirrors the note's current title_
    1.  This is sometimes also called "reference link".
    2.  The title of this link cannot be changed. Instead, it will always show the current title of the linked note.
    3.  The icon of the linked note will also be displayed.
2.  _Link title can be changed arbitrarily_
    1.  This will create a traditional hyperlink, where the text of the link can be different from the note title.

## In-place linking

You can also insert internal links “inline” by using the `@` symbol:

1.  Type `@` in a text note, which will open the note search menu.
2.  Search for the desired note's title by typing a few characters. Use <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> to select the correct note, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Tab</kbd> to create the link. It's also possible to create new notes with this method by typing a non-existing note title and selecting _Create and link child note_.

## Pasting internal links

You can also insert internal links by copying a note from the note tree.

1.  In the <a class="reference-link" href="../../../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Note%20Tree.md">Note Tree</a>, select a note and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.
2.  In a text note, paste the link by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>.
