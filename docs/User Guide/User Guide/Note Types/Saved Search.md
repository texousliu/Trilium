# Saved Search
Trilium allows you to save common searches as notes within the note tree. The search results will appear as sub-notes under these "saved search" notes. Here is an example of how it works:

<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-center" style="width:50%;"><img style="aspect-ratio:812/585;" src="Saved Search_saved-search.gif" width="812" height="585"></figure>

## Location

By default, saved searches are stored in the day note. However, you can designate a different note to store saved searches by marking it with the `#searchHome` label. Additionally, for [workspaces](../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Navigation/Workspace.md), you can use the `#workspaceSearchHome` label to specify a storage location for saved searches within that workspace.
