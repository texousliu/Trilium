The mindmap allows for easy jotting down of ideas and storing them in a hierarchical fashion.

## Terminology

*   A **node** is a single idea, represented differently based on depth (filled rounded rectangle for the root note, unfilled rectangles for sub-ideas, lines only for sub-sub-ideas).
*   The **root node** is the top-most node from which all other nodes derive, displayed as a filled rectangle. There can only be a single root node.

## Interaction

*   To create a new node at the same level as the current one, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, enter the desired text and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> once again to confirm.
*   Similarly, to create a sub-node, press <kbd>Tab</kbd>, enter the desired text and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
*   To create a parent, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> instead.
*   To remove a node, press <kbd>Delete</kbd>.
*   To move a node up or down, press <kbd>Page Up</kbd> or <kbd>Page Down</kbd>.
*   To adjust the font size, color of the text or background or to add a link, click on a node and use the floating panel that appears to the right.
*   To select one or more notes, drag and drop across the map.
*   Right click the node to bring a contextual menu with options such as creating new nodes, focusing on a particular notes or creating links between them.
*   Use the buttons at the top-left to change the positioning of the nodes relative to the root node (to the left, to the right, or to both sides).
*   In the <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Floating%20buttons.md">Floating buttons</a> area:
    *   An [image reference](Text/Images/Image%20references.md) can be copied, to paste the mind map in a text note.
    *   The diagram can be exported either as SVG (vectorial) or PNG (raster).
    *   The note can be togged [read-only](../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Notes/Read-Only%20Notes.md).
