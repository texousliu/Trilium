### Saved SQL console

SQL queries or commands can be saved into a dedicated note.

To do so, simply write the query and press the ![](1_SQL%20Console_image.png)button. Once saved, the note will appear in [Day Notes](../../Advanced%20Showcases/Day%20Notes.md).

*   The SQL expression will not be displayed by default, but it can still be viewed by going to the note context menu and selecting _Note source_.
*   The expression cannot be modified. If needed, recreate it by copying the statement back into the SQL console and then saving it again.
