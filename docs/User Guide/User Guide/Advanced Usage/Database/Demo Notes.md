# Demo Notes
When you run Trilium for the first time, it will generate a new database containing demo notes. These notes showcase its many features, such as:

*   <a class="reference-link" href="../../Note%20Types/Relation%20Map.md">Relation Map</a>
*   <a class="reference-link" href="../Advanced%20Showcases/Day%20Notes.md">Day Notes</a>
*   <a class="reference-link" href="../Advanced%20Showcases/Weight%20Tracker.md">Weight Tracker</a>
*   <a class="reference-link" href="../Advanced%20Showcases/Task%20Manager.md">Task Manager</a>
*   <a class="reference-link" href="../../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Themes.md">Themes</a>

### Restoring Demo Notes

There are some cases in which you may want to restore the original demo notes. For example, if you experimented with some of the more advanced features and want to see the original reference, or if you simply want to explore the latest version of the demo notes, which might showcase new features.

You can easily restore the demo notes by using Trilium's built-in import feature by importing them:

*   Download [the .zip archive](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/raw/refs/heads/main/apps/server/src/assets/db/demo.zip) with the latest version of the demo notes
*   Right click on any note in your tree under which you would like the demo notes to be imported
*   Click "Import into note"
*   Select the .zip archive to import it
