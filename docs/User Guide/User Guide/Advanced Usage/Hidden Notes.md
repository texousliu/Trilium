# Hidden Notes

For easy extensibility, a lot of features in Trilium make use of actual notes to store information as opposed to having them stored in a separate location in the database. This allows some functions such as <a class="reference-link" href="Attributes.md">Attributes</a>, <a class="reference-link" href="Attributes/Relations.md">Relations</a> or even <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Navigation/Search.md">Search</a> and <a class="reference-link" href="../Note%20Types/Text/Links.md">Links</a> to be able to operate on them.

As the name suggests, these notes are hidden to the user by default to prevent cluttering the note tree and to prevent them from being accidentally deleted.

The hidden notes are stored in the user's <a class="reference-link" href="Database.md">Database</a> just like normal notes, but they have a unique <a class="reference-link" href="Note%20ID.md">Note ID</a> which allows them to be distinguished from the normal ones.

## Accessing the hidden note tree

From the <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Global%20menu.md">Global menu</a>, select _Advanced_ → _Show Hidden Subtree_.

## Contents of the hidden note tree

Here is a brief summary of all the notes within the hidden tree:
