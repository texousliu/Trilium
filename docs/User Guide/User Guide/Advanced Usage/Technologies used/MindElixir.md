# MindElixir
MindElixir is the library we are using for the [Mind Map](../../Note%20Types/Mind%20Map.md) note types.

The main library is available on [GitHub as mind-elixir-core](https://github.com/SSShooter/mind-elixir-core/issues).

The library is embedded as-is without additional modifications.

Issues with its functionality should generally be reported [upstream](https://github.com/ssshooter/mind-elixir-core).

## Plugins

MindElixir supports plugins, and one such plugin we are making use of is [SSShooter/node-menu: A node menu plugin of mind-elixir](https://github.com/SSShooter/node-menu), which allows editing the fonts, colors, links of nodes.
