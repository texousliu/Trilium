# Relations
A relation is similar to a [label](Labels.md), but instead of having a text value it refers to another note.

## Creating a relation using the visual editor

1.  Go to the _Owned Attributes_ section in the <a class="reference-link" href="../../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Ribbon.md">Ribbon</a>.
2.  Press the + button (_Add new attribute_) to the right.
3.  Select _Add new relation_ for the relation.

> [!TIP]
> If you prefer keyboard shortcuts, press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> while focused on a note or in the _Owned Attributes_ section to display the visual editor.

While in the visual editor:

*   Set the desired name
*   Set the Target note (the note to point to). Unlike labels, relations cannot exist with a target note.
*   Check _Inheritable_ if the label should be inherited by the child notes as well. See <a class="reference-link" href="Attribute%20Inheritance.md">Attribute Inheritance</a> for more information.

## Creating a relation manually

In the _Owned Attributes_ section in the <a class="reference-link" href="../../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Ribbon.md">Ribbon</a>:

*   To create a relation called `myRelation`:
    *   First type `~myRelation=@` .
    *   After this, an autocompletion box should appear.
    *   Type the title of the note to point to and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm (or click the desired note).
    *   Alternatively copy a note from the <a class="reference-link" href="../../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Note%20Tree.md">Note Tree</a> and paste it after the `=` sign (without the `@` , in this case).
*   To create an inheritable relation, follow the same steps as previously described but instead of `~myRelation` write `~myRelation(inheritable)`.

## Predefined relations

These relations are supported and used internally by Trilium.

> [!TIP]
> Some relations presented here end with a `*`. That means that there are multiple relations with the same prefix, consult the specific page linked in the description of that relation for more information.
