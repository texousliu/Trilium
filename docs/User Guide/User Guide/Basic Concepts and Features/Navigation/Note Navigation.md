# Note Navigation
One of the Trilium's goals is to provide fast and comfortable navigation between notes.

## Backwards and forward

To move back and forward in history of viewed pages:

*   The <a class="reference-link" href="../UI%20Elements/Launch%20Bar.md">Launch Bar</a> can be configured to display navigation buttons (see _Go to Next Note_ and _Go to Previous Note_ in _Available Launchers_).
*   On the left side of the [tab bar](../UI%20Elements/Tabs.md), there are two dedicated buttons.
    *   These buttons will appear only if the launch bar is not already displaying the history navigation buttons to avoid duplication.
*   Alternatively, use the <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Right</kbd> keyboard shortcuts.

## Jump to note

This is useful to quickly find and view arbitrary notes - click on `Jump to` button on the top or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> . Then type part of the note name and autocomplete will help you pick the desired note.

See <a class="reference-link" href="Jump%20to.md">Jump to...</a> for more information.
