The _Quick search_ function does a full-text search (that is, it searches through the content of notes and not just the title of a note) and displays the result in an easy-to-access manner.

The alternative to the quick search is the <a class="reference-link" href="Search.md">Search</a> function, which opens in a dedicated tab and has support for advanced queries.

For even faster navigation, it's possible to use <a class="reference-link" href="Jump%20to%20Note.md">Jump to Note</a> which will only search through the note titles instead of the content.

## Layout

Based on the <a class="reference-link" href="../UI%20Elements/Vertical%20and%20horizontal%20layout.md">Vertical and horizontal layout</a>, the quick search is placed:

*   On the vertical layout, it is displayed right above the <a class="reference-link" href="../UI%20Elements/Note%20Tree.md">Note Tree</a>.
*   On the horizontal layout, it is displayed in the <a class="reference-link" href="../UI%20Elements/Launch%20Bar.md">Launch Bar</a>, where it can be positioned just like any other icon.
