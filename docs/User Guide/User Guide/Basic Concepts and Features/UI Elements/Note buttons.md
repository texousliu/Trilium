# Note buttons
To the right of the [Ribbon](Ribbon.md) there are a few more buttons: ![](Note%20buttons_image.png)

*   The Note Revisions button displays the [Note Revisions](../Notes/Note%20Revisions.md) for that particular note.
*   The contextual menu offers commands for the note or its subtree, such as import, export, viewing the [Note source code](../../Advanced%20Usage/Note%20source.md) or [Attachments](../Notes/Attachments.md).

On the <a class="reference-link" href="New%20Layout.md">New Layout</a>, the button area is populated by some more buttons that are specific to the current note. For example, for Image and <a class="reference-link" href="../../Note%20Types/File.md">File</a> notes, the download and copy buttons were relocated there.
