# Note Tree
This page explains how to manipulate the note tree in TriliumNext, focusing on moving notes.

## Drag and Drop

You can easily rearrange the note tree by dragging and dropping notes, as demonstrated in the example above.

## Keyboard Manipulation

![Example of using keyboard keys to move a note](Note%20Tree_move-note-with-k.gif)Trilium offers efficient keyboard-based manipulation using the following [shortcuts](../Keyboard%20Shortcuts.md):

*   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd><span>↑</span></kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +<kbd><span>↓</span></kbd>: Move the note up or down in the order.
*   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd><span>←</span></kbd>: Move the note up in the hierarchy by changing its parent to the note's grandparent.
*   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd><span>→</span></kbd>: Move the note down in the hierarchy by setting its parent to the note currently above it (this action is best understood through a demo or hands-on experience).
*   <kbd><span>←</span></kbd> and <kbd><span>→</span></kbd>: Expand and collapse a sub-tree.

## Context Menu

You can also move notes using the familiar cut and paste functions available in the context menu, or with the associated keyboard [shortcuts](../Keyboard%20Shortcuts.md): `CTRL-C` ( [copy](../Notes/Cloning%20Notes.md)), <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> (cut) and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> (paste).
