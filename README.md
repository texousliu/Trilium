## ⚠️ Why TriliumNext?

[The original Trilium project is in maintenance mode](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/issues/4620).

### Migrating from Trilium?

There are no special migration steps to migrate from a zadam/Trilium instance to a TriliumNext/Notes instance. Simply [install TriliumNext/Notes](#-installation) as usual and it will use your existing database.

Versions up to and including [v0.90.4](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/releases/tag/v0.90.4) are compatible with the latest zadam/trilium version of [v0.63.7](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/releases/tag/v0.63.7). Any later versions of TriliumNext have their sync versions incremented.

## 📖 Documentation

We're currently in the progress of moving the documentation to in-app (hit the `F1` key within Trilium). As a result, there may be some missing parts until we've completed the migration. If you'd prefer to navigate through the documentation within GitHub, you can navigate the [User Guide](./docs/User%20Guide/User%20Guide/) documentation. 

Below are some quick links for your convenience to navigate the documentation:
- [Server installation](./docs/User%20Guide/User%20Guide/Installation%20&%20Setup/Server%20Installation.md)
  - [Docker installation](./docs/User%20Guide/User%20Guide/Installation%20&%20Setup/Server%20Installation/1.%20Installing%20the%20server/Using%20Docker.md)
- [Upgrading TriliumNext](./docs/User%20Guide/User%20Guide/Installation%20%26%20Setup/Upgrading%20TriliumNext.md)
